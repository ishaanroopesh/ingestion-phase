The \\nsurgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated the \\nprocedure well. Patient received perioperative IV antibiotics.\\n\\nPostoperative course was remarkable for the following:\\n\\nOn POD#0, she was oliguric and was bloused 500cc NS. On POD #1, \\nshe was hypotensive and bloused 1L of NS and continued to be \\nhypotensive. Later in the day she became hypotensive, short of \\nbreath, and hypoxic. A CXR was obtained and was unremarkable. A \\nCTA was ordered which was negative for a pulmonary embolism. \\nPOD# 2, she continued to have low O2 sats. She was weaned down \\non her oxygen and respond well when ambulating with physical \\ntherapy, but would de-sat upon laying flat. Medicine was \\nconsulted which recommended getting a BNP which was mildly \\nelevated, and Tropins which were within normal limits. On POD \\n#3, Her oxygen saturation improved. \\n\\nOtherwise, pain was controlled with a combination of IV and oral \\npain medications.  The patient received Aspirin for DVT \\nprophylaxis.  Labs were checked throughout the hospital course \\nand repleted accordingly. At the time of discharge the patient \\nwas tolerating a regular diet and feeling well.  The patient was \\nafebrile with stable vital signs.  The patient's hematocrit was \\nacceptable and pain was adequately controlled on an oral \\nregimen.

Discharge Instructions: 1. Please return to the emergency department or notify your \\nphysician if you experience any of the following: severe pain \\nnot relieved by medication, increased swelling, decreased \\nsensation, difficulty with movement, fevers greater than 101.5, \\nshaking chills, increasing redness or drainage from the incision \\nsite, chest pain, shortness of breath or any other concerns.\\n\\n2. Please follow up with your primary physician regarding this \\nadmission and any new medications and refills. \\n\\n3. Resume your home medications unless otherwise instructed.\\n\\n4.
