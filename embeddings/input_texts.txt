IMAGING:
========
CT ABD PLV w/oral Contrast  (___)

IMPRESSION: 
1.  Interval (since ___ placement of a colonic stent,
2.  Circumscribed 10.4 x 7.4mm anterior pelvic fluid collection 
containing small locules of gas, likely an abscess from sigmoid 
tumor perforation. This is amenable to drainage.
2a.  Moderate/large amount of free air, and small amount of free 
fluid within the peritoneum.
3. Extensive lymphadenopathy in the retroperitoneum and porta 
hepatis, which results in narrowing of the origin of the left 
renal vein. Encasement of the splenic vein-SMV confluence and 
bilateral renal arteries is also demonstrated, without 
significant intraluminal narrowing in these vessels.  Normally 
enhancing kidneys on today's study.
4. Innumerable hepatic metastases.
5. Innumerable pulmonary metastases, lungs only partially 
imaged.
6. Moderately-sized bilateral non-hemorrhagic pleural effusions.

___ Flexible sigmoidoscopy
A circumferential mass was encountered at the rectosigmoid 
junction around 15 cm from the anal verge highly suspcious for 
primary colorectal cancer. The colonoscope was unable to 
traverse the stricture which was estimated at around 9mm in 
diameter.The mass was very friable. (biopsy)
Otherwise normal sigmoidoscopy to distal sigmoid colon.

Sigmoidoscopy ___:
Contents: Solid green stool was found in the rectum. No fresh or 
old blood was noted.  A metal stent was found in the rectum. 
There is mild tumor ingrowth into the mid-portion of the stent. 
This area is friable with some bleeding from passage of the 
endoscope - likely source of bleeding.   
Impression: Stent in the rectum
Stool in the rectum
Otherwise normal sigmoidoscopy to splenic flexure 
Recommendations: Stool softners and laxatives as d/w inpatient 
team. 
Oral iron 

CXR ___:
IMPRESSION:    
There is no clear radiographic change over the past 11 days.  
Bilateral 
pleural effusions moderate on the right small on the left and 
callus pulmonary nodules are unchanged. Extent of central 
adenopathy is better revealed by the chest CT scan. 
  
Confluent opacification at the base of the right lung is 
probably atelectasis, pleural mild pneumonia is difficult to 
exclude.  In all other locations there no findings that would 
raise the possibility of pneumonia. 

___ ___:
FINDINGS:  
There is normal compressibility, flow and augmentation of the 
bilateral common femoral, proximal, mid, distal femoral, and 
popliteal veins. Normal color flow and compressibility are 
demonstrated in the posterior tibial and peroneal veins. There 
is normal respiratory variation in the common femoral veins 
bilaterally. No evidence of medial popliteal fossa (___) cyst. 

  
IMPRESSION:  
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the bilaterallower 
extremity veins. 

EKG ___: 
Narrow complex tachycardia. Probably sinus tachycardia. Compared 
to the 
previous tracing of ___ the rate has increased. 

CXR ___:
FINDINGS:  
Numerous nodular opacities compatible the patient's metastatic 
disease are again appreciated. In addition, there is worsening 
pulmonary edema as well as a worsening right lower lobe 
infiltrate which could represent pneumonia in the correct 
clinical setting. A right pleural effusion is also increased in 
size. 
  
IMPRESSION:    
Worsening combination of pleural effusion, pulmonary edema and 
possibly 
pneumonia particularly in the right lower lobe. 

CTA CHEST W/ CONTRAST ___:
IMPRESSION:  
1. Partially limited evaluation of the subsegmental pulmonary 
arteries, 
however no evidence of central, lobar, or segmental pulmonary 
embolism.

innumerable pulmonary metastases, as well as enlargement of 
bilateral pleural effusions, large on the right and moderate on 
the left. 
3. Partially imaged upper abdomen demonstrates diffuse 
intrahepatic metastasis and considerable upper abdominal 
lymphadenopathy. 

KUB ___:
IMPRESSION:    
1.  Rectal stent overlying the sacrum. 
2. No bowel obstruction. 
3. Likely interval decrease of small right pleural effusion. 

CT ABDOMEN PELVIS W/ CONTRAST ___:
IMPRESSION:  
1.  Interval (since ___ placement of a colonic stent,

___ CT Abdomen:
There is massive dilatation of the transverse colon measuring up 
to 13.7 cm. This is similar to slightly progressed when compared 
to the prior study.  The presence of air in the descending colon 
and rectum makes mechanical obstruction less likely.  There is 
bowel wall edema evident in the descending colon consistent with 
the findings on the prior CT.  There is loss of normal haustra 
pattern within the massively distended transverse colon.  Toxic 
megacolon cannot be excluded however the time course with 
stability over a 6 day period is not typical.  No free air seen.

___ CXR (TB screen):
The tip of the PICC projects over the distal SVC.  There is no 
focal
consolidation.  There is no pleural effusion.  The trachea is 
midline.  The aorta is atherosclerotic and tortuous.  
Degenerative changes are evident in the spine.

___ MRE enterography:
1. Active inflammation involving an approximately 8.0 cm segment 
of sigmoid colon, with wall thickening and pericolonic vascular 
prominence.
2. Subacute inflammation involving the rectum.  Please note that 
the anal canal was not included on this examination.
3. Ahaustral dilated transverse colon and ahaustral nondilated 
descending colon, suggesting chronic inflammation.  Focal 
narrowed caliber of the proximal transverse colon with the lumen 
measuring 1.3 cm, similar to prior CT.
4. No evidence of small bowel inflammation.
5. Fusiform 4.9 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm.
6. Small bowel containing right inguinal hernia.  No evidence of 
obstruction.

sphincterotomy was performed. Cannulation was successful and 
deep with a ___ tapered catheter using a free-hand technique. 
Contrast medium was injected resulting in complete 
opacification.  A single 5 mm round stone that was causing 
partial obstruction was seen at the upper third of the common 
bile duct.  After the small pre-cut needle knife sphincterotomy 
and cannulation a 10mm wire guided CRE balloon was introduced 
for dilation biliary sphincteroplasty and the diameter was 
progressively increased to 12 mm successfully.  2 stones were

IMAGING:
___ CT abdomen/pelvis
HISTORY:  Lung cancer, status post transurethral resection of 
bladder tumor on ___ presenting with abdominal pain. 

  
TECHNIQUE:  CT images were obtained at ___ are 
presented for second review.  Of note, CT images were obtained 
at ___ through the chest, abdomen and pelvis.  However, 
it is only the images through the abdomen and pelvis which are 
requested for ___ review and while this series contains the 
other images, these will not be commented on as a formal report 
has been issued by the referring hospital.  While a formal 
abdomen and pelvis report has also been issued, a ___ report is 
being issued to clarify findings within the abdomen and pelvis.  
 
  
COMPARISON:  None. 
  
FINDINGS: 
CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  The imaged lung bases demonstrate a 
small right pleural effusion and bibasilar atelectasis with 
emphysema. The heart and pericardium are unremarkable without 
effusion. The pulmonary emboli are better assessed on the CT 
Chest but basilar opacity could reflect atelectasis, however 
infarct cannot be excluded. 
  
The liver is normal in attenuation without focal lesion, intra 
or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.  The gallbladder is 
decompressed.  The pancreas, spleen and right adrenal gland are 
unremarkable.  Nodularity is seen in the left adrenal gland of 
uncertain significance, measuring up to 16 mm (7:22) with a 
second nodule in the lateral limb of the left adrenal gland 
measuring 9 mm (7:24).  The kidneys enhance and excrete contrast 
symmetrically without hydronephrosis.   
  
The stomach, small and large bowel are unremarkable with 
equivocal 
hyperenhancement of the right lower quadrant small bowel loops 
and may be 
reactive to the free fluid.  The large bowel contains multiple 
diverticula, but none demonstrate active inflammatory changes.  
There is no free air in the abdomen.  The appendix is seen and 
is normal.  Mild stranding is seen in the mesentery likely 
communicating with a moderate volume of free fluid within the 
pelvis.  There is no pathologic mesenteric or retroperitoneal 
lymph node enlargement.  The aorta and major branches appear 
patent and normal in caliber with minimal vascular 
calcifications. 
  
CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  The bladder is decompressed with a 
thickened wall and Foley catheter within. The degree of bladder 
wall thickening is greater than just due to decompression alone. 
Multiple bladder diverticula are identified (7:69), 2 of which 
appear to contain stones.  A small to moderate volume of free 
fluid is seen in the pelvis.  There is no pelvic or inguinal 
lymph node enlargement. The prostate is mildly enlarged. 
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  There is no suspicious lytic or blastic 
bony lesion to suggest osseous malignancy.   
IMPRESSION: 
1.  Right lower quadrant free fluid could be reactive to bladder 
wall 
thickening; correlate with urinalysis to exclude infectious 
causes. Right 
lower quadrant small bowel loops appear mildly hyperenhancing 
which could 
reflect enteritis or reactive changes.  
2.  Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.  Normal appendix.    
3. Multiple bladder diverticula which contain small bladder 
stones.

# PE: Pt presented with hypoxia, At risk given recent surgery 
and previous history of malignancy so we can call this provoked 
PE. He was maintained on heparin for anticoagulation and 
transitioned to lovenox on HD2. He was put on continuous O2 
monitoring and telemetry, and on HD 2 no longer required oxygen. 
Walking pulse ox prior to discharge 92% with adequate heart rate 
control. Will require 6months of anticoagulation with lovenox 
SC, as patient declined warafarin therapy.

# Abdominal pain/nausea: Could be related to bladder cancer and 
TURBT, or enteritis noted on CT. Pt. denies diarrhea, nausea, 
vomiting. Final read of CT showed that the changes were related 
to bladder wall thickening secondary to malignancy and recent 
surgical procedure. The patient was briefly put on GI 
precautions to rule out viral gastroenteritis but this was 
discontinued once final CT report was received. He was given 
ativan and bismuth for symptom control and improved. Oxybutnin 
was also continued for bladder spasm and discharged on this 
medication.

#?UTI/bladder irritation: Foley continued to drain bloody urine. 
UA more consistent with post-surgical bleeding and bladder 
irritation. Decision was made to treat empirically with 
ciprofloxacin for 5 days.

evolution of the infarct; however, new infarcts are also 
possible.  Consider MRI to 
evaluate for acute or progressive infarct if clinically 
indicated. The left common carotid artery is widely patent 
status post endarterectomy. 
Patent right carotid arterie, vertebral arteries and major 
branches.  
  

___:  MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST

IMPRESSION:  Multiple, predominantly left infarctions as above, 
with interval increase in the size of infarctions seen 
previously, as well as multiple new foci of infarction, 
including a right paramedian focus.  A small amount of interval 
susceptibility artifact in the confluent left frontal infarction 
suggests minimal interval intracranial blood. 

___:  MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST

IMPRESSION:  Redemonstration of numerous bilateral cerebral foci 
of abnormally slow diffusion consistent with infarction, overall 
unchanged from the most recent comparison.  A small amount of 
left frontal hypointensity on gradient-echo imaging suggesting

ERCP: The scout film was normal. During biliary cannulation, the 
pancreatic duct was partially filled with contrast and 
visualized proximally. The course and caliber of the duct was 
normal with no evidence of filling defects, masses, chronic 
pancreatitis or other abnormalities. The bile duct was deeply 
cannulated with the sphincterotome. Contrast was injected and 
there was brisk flow through the ducts. Contrast extended to the 
entire biliary tree. The CBD was 8mm in diameter. One filling 
defect consistent with a stone was identified in the distal CBD. 
Opacification of the gallbladder was incomplete. The left and 
right hepatic ducts and all intrahepatic branches were normal. 
A biliary sphincterotomy was made with a sphincterotome. There 
was no post-sphincterotomy bleeding. The biliary tree was swept 
with a balloon starting at the bifurcation. One stone was 
removed. The CBD and CHD were swept repeatedly until no further 
stones were seen. Excellent bile and contrast drainage was seen 
endoscopically and fluoroscopically. Overall, successful ERCP 
with sphincterotomy and stone extraction. Medications On Admission: The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.

Major Surgical Or Invasive Procedure: None History Of Present Illness: History was noted from Dr. ___ consult note from  ___, and subsequent psychiatry CL 
notes
in OMR, confirmed with patient and updated as relevant:

Briefly, Patient is a ___ year old man with history of EtOH Use
Disorder, Depression and past Paranoid Ideation, medical history
of HTN, HLD who presents to the ___ ___ with progressively
worsening depression c/b hopelessness with suicidal ideation in
the context of self-discontinuing his psychiatric medications
approximately 2 weeks ago as well as multiple psychosocial
stressors. 

Per Dr. ___ ___ consultation note:
"On interview, patient states that he has been experiencing
severe
depression over the past two weeks with frequent thoughts of SI. 

He reports prominent hopelessness, low energy, sleep
interruptions, poor motivation and decreased interest.  He 
denies
plan or intent in regards to suicidality, but reflects that he
"wants to get help before I get that bad again."  

Patient reports that his depression became notably worse in the
context of his brother becoming acutely ill approximately 6
months ago.  During this time, he was regularly caring for his
brother, who was on the waiting list for an organ transplant;
however, he passed away 2 months ago before he was able to
receive one.  Since his brother's passing, he reports that his
nieces and nephews have been taking advantage of him.  

Patient reports that approximately one month ago, he "checked
myself into ___" for similar symptoms of depression, 
along
with suicidal ideation and plan to kill himself by "strapping
weights to my body and drowning myself."  He found the
hospitalization helpful, but did not follow-up with aftercare 
and
stopped taking his psychiatric medications once he ran out.

In order to "snap myself out of the depression," he recently
grinded his thumb into a block of wood.  He reflects that he had
hoped the physical pain would improve his emotional pain, but 
now
is experiencing both types of pain.  

He also reports a history of paranoid ideation, reflecting that
it tends to get worse when his depression is bad.  He reports
that recently he has been feeling that "people are going to harm
me."  

On admission interview, patient confirms much of the above. He
reports being depressed for the past ___ months, with the
depression worsening in the past couple of months after the 
death
of his brother. He discusses how he left his own apartment to
move in with his brother and care for him. His brother's two 
sons
did not want him living there, and ultimately forced the patient
to leave. Shortly after the patient moved out, his brother 
passed
away. The patient believes it is because he was not being cared
for properly. He states that his nephews may have issues with
drugs. He states that he was hospitalized at ___ about 1
month ago. After he left, he went to ___. While he was 
there,
he was told that he would be unable to leave to go to his
psychiatry appointment. He left there after staying for about 5
days. He has since been living with either his sister or 
friends,
however he suspects that his friend is involved with drugs. 

He reports "erratic" sleep, decreased appetite with a ___ lb
weight loss in the past few weeks, decreased energy, and
decreased concentration. He reports that about a month ago he
thought about jumping off of a bridge with a weight attached to
him, however he has since learned that suicide is a moral sin,
and he no longer would want to commit suicide for that reason.
Denies current SI. States that he feels safe on the unit. He
reports recent self harm behaviors, as above, of rubbing his
thumb into wood in order to inflict pain on himself to "snap 
out"
of his depression.   

Psychiatric ROS:
Depression - as per HPI
Psychosis - reports that he has had paranoia for most of his
adult life, stating that he used to feel like people wanted to
kill him. Continues to report some paranoia, but states that it

male with rheumatoid arthritis, DMARD holiday, and recent, brief
hospitalization for presumptive pericarditis, returned to 
outside
hospital with probable cardiac tamponade now post-bedside
pericardiocentesis with drain placement prior to transfer.
Importantly, patient was hospitalized at ___ on ___ with acute pleuritic chest pain of two-day duration in the
context of constellation of fatigue, malaise, upper respiratory
symptoms, and non-productive cough. While CTA exonerated
pulmonary embolism, thickened pericardium and small effusion 
were
noted, suggesting pericarditis. ECG revealed subtle diffuse ST
elevations in keeping with pericarditis. Echocardiogram 
confirmed
said effusion, though no features of tamponade were appreciated.
He was discharged the same day with ibuprofen 600 mg TID and
colchicine 0.6 mg BID. He had persistence of minor residual 
chest
pain, which began to worsen two days later, but was tolerable
until yesterday evening when it evolved to severe, unrelenting
pain across his precordium likened to "wearing shoulder pads
bearing down on him." He notes a new concurrent substernal chest
pain that "goes straight to his back." He then became dyspneic,
prompting him to seek care. He arrived at ___ hypotensive
with SBP in the 80-range. He was borderline tachycardic and in
mild respiratory distress, but oxygenation was acceptable. He
rapidly received three liters of fluid for presumptive tamponade
within the confines of poor windows on bedside echocardiogram.
Pericardiocentesis yielded 400 cc or more of serous fluid and a
pericardial drain was placed. Hemodynamics rapidly improved. On
arrival to ___ ED, patient was indeed hemodynamically stable
but was then in moderate respiratory distress, requiring
non-rebreather. He was given Lasix 20 mg IV. Bedside
echocardiogram was limited, but preliminarily suggestive of 
small
residual effusion. In the CCU, patient notes resurgence of said
chest pain. His dyspnea is improving. An additional 250 cc was
drained. Past Medical History: PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:

Imaging:

CXR ___:
IMPRESSION:  Mild perihilar prominence, suspected to represent 
mildly prominent pulmonary vessels without definite pneumonia.  
Streaky left basilar opacification seen only on the frontal view 
is probably due to minor atelectasis or scarring. 
.  
CT A/P ___: 
1.  No acute intra-abdominal pathology. There is diverticulosis 
and sequelae of prior inflammation, but no active 
diverticulitis. 
2.  3-mm nodule seen along the right major fissure and right 
lower lobe.  According to ___ guidelines, in the absence 
of risk factors, no further followup is needed.  If patient has 
risk factors such as smoking, followup chest CT at 12 months is 
recommended to document stability. 

CXR ___:
There are low lung volumes with an appearance of bronchovascular 
crowding.  Despite this, there is likely mild vascular 
congestion and edema.  No focal consolidation is seen with 
linear bibasilar atelectasis.  The heart is top normal in size 
with aortic totuosity.

# Fevers: Likely secondary to pneumonia, but possibly a viral 
illness. Most likely not bacterial process but no leukocytosis, 
just PMN predominance. Urine legionella neg. CXR underwhelming 
for pnuemonia but given poor PO intake and overall constellation 
of symptoms without other localizing source and neg CT, so 
patient was treated presumptively for CAP.  O2 sats stable on 
room air during the day, but at night de-satted.  On exam, lungs 
with improved wheezing since yesterday. With ambulation, O2 87, 
on ___, repeat cxr with pulm edema likely due to IV fluid bolus 
day prior. She was given lasix 40mg POx1.  On day of d/c, sats 
mid ___ on RA, down to 88% with prolonged ambulation.  Pt not 
subjectively SOB, likely this is baseline given pt's habitus.  
Treated with albuterol nebs and Levofloxacin 750mg PO daily.  On 
d/c, will complete 5 day course of levofloxacin.  
.  
# Hypotnatremia: Na 134 on am of discharge, improved from lowest 
of 129 .  Based on urine lytes/osm and serum osm, most likely 
SIADH secondary to pulmonary process.

Studies:
L-Spine XR ___:
There is severe diffuse osteopenia. There is a wedge compression 
fracture of
the L1 one vertebral body with loss of height of approximately 
30%. There is
marked kyphosis centered at the T12/L1 level. Remaining 
vertebral body
heights are preserved. There is an exaggerated lordosis and left 
scoliosis.
There is severe facet arthrosis, most pronounced in the lower 
lumbar spine
from L3 through S1. There is mild-to-moderate disc space 
narrowing at
multiple levels in the lumbar spine, with small marginal 
osteophytes at
multiple levels. No other compression fractures are detected. 
Scattered
aortic calcification is present.
 
Compared with ___, the degree of compression at L1 has 
worsened, minimal
retrolisthesis of L1 on L2 is similar, but possibly slightly 
worse, the degree
of retropulsion of the posterior cortex of L1 is worse ,and the 
degree of
kyphosis and degree of scoliosis also appears slightly worse.

INTERPRETATION: This ___ year old active man with a history of 
factor 
V Leiden, HTN and HL was referred to the lab for evaluation of 
atypical 
chest discomfort for evaluation following negative serial 
cardiac 
markers. The patient exercised for 8 minutes of ___ protocol 
and 
stopped for fatigue. The estimated peak MET capacity was 9.2 
which 
represents an excellent functional capacity for his age. No arm, 
neck, 
back or chest discomfort was reported by the patient throughout 
the 
study. There were no significant ST segment changes during 
exercise or 
in recovery. The rhythm was sinus with occasional isolated apbs, 

several atrial couplets and one vpb. The ectopy was more 
frequent near 
peak exercise and in early recovery. Appropriate hemodynamic 
response 
to exercise and recovery. 
IMPRESSION: No anginal type symptoms or ischemic EKG changes.

CT abdomen/pelvis ___ report: 
FINDINGS: 
In the liver there are now at least 5 low attenuation masses. 
The larger 2 measure 4.4 cm, previously measured 1.2 cm and 3.8 
cm which previously measured 1.4 cm. These are seen on image 24 
and image 44. 
New masss are present measuring 2.5 cm on image 31 and 1.3 cm 
and image 27 and a subcentimeter lesion on image 33. The common 
duct is very dilated mass measuring up to 2 cm with some 
intrahepatic ductal dilatation. This has been present previously 
but may be slightly worse. An ampullary lesion cannot be 
excluded. There is some sludge 
within the gallbladder. The pancreatic duct is mildly dilated, 
unchanged. The spleen and adrenal glands are normal. The right 
kidney is unremarkable. The Left kidney has a 1.4 cm 
hyperintense cyst unchanged. The small bowel and colon are 
normal in caliber and appearance. The prostate is enlarged with 
scattered calcifications. The prostate makes an impression upon 
the base of the bladder. 
The lung bases are clear. Bone windows do not demonstrate any 
suspicious lesions. There are extensive degenerative changes 
within the spine and within the hips, left worse than right. 
IMPRESSION: 
Multiple enlarging masses within the liver, very worrisome for 
metastatic disease. The common duct is quite dilated with some 
intrahepatic ductal dilatation and dilatation of the pancreatic 
duct, and ampullary lesion cannot be excluded. Otherwise there 
has been no significant interval change in the abdomen or 
Pelvis.

Colonoscopy: mass at 15cm. Stool passing through but near 
obstructive. 

Sigmoidoscopy ___:
A stenosis was at 15cm from the anal verge consistent with a 
malignant stricture. The scope did not traverse the lesion. A 
90cm by 22mm (WallFlex Colonic stent ___ metal 
stent was placed successfully. Under fluoroscopic guidance a 
standard 15 mm biliary extraction balloon was passed through the 
therapeutic upper endoscope into the colon traversing the 
stricture.  As contrast was injected a tight, 4cm, stenosis was 
seen.  The balloon catether was removed and 0.035 in x ___ cm 
Jagwire was left in place within the sigmoid colon.  An 
uncovered colonic metal stent was slowly advanced over the 
guidewire through the stricture under fluoroscopic 
visualization.  Final position of the stent was visualized on 
fluoroscopy and remained in excellent position traversing the 
stricture. Final fluoroscopic views show adequate luminal 
patency. Medications On Admission: The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.

Gait; deferred
On discharge her main deficit was the left extremity. Her 
Strength was ___ at wrist flexion and ___ at finger flexion. ___ 
of finger extension, Wrist extension. She had a left facial 
droop. Gait was stable with a walker. Pertinent Results: ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect 
or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline 
contrast with maneuvers. However the image quality for the 
agitated saline contrast study was suboptimal so cannot 
definitively exclude an intracardiac shunt. There is mild 
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular 
cavity size is normal. Right ventricular chamber size and free 
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly 
thickened. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild 
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets 
are mildly thickened. There is borderline pulmonary artery 
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. 

No cardiac source of embolus identified (cannot definitively 
exclude).  

MRI Brain:
FINDINGS: In comparison with the most recent examination, again 
a 7 x 11 mm 
anterior communicating artery aneurysm is redemonstrated, there 
is no evidence 
of acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. There is no 
evidence of 
hydrocephalus. An area of restricted diffusion is identified 
involving the 
posterior aspect of the right caudate nucleus, extending 
inferiorly along the 
posterior limb of the right internal capsule and right putamen 
with no 
evidence of hemorrhagic transformation. These areas demonstrate 
low signal 
intensity in the corresponding ADC confirming restricted 
diffusion. Few foci 
of high signal intensity are demonstrated in the subcortical 
white matter, 
which are nonspecific and may represent areas of small vessel 
disease. 
  
The orbits are unremarkable, the paranasal sinuses demonstrate 
mucosal 
thickening at the ethmoidal, sphenoid and maxillary sinuses with 
polypoid 
formations, possibly representing a mucous retention cyst. Medications On Admission: Metoprolol Unknown dose

ERCP:
Normal major papilla. 
Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a
sphincterotome using a ___ technique. Contrast medium was
injected resulting in complete opacification. There was a 
filling
defect that appeared like sludge in the lower third of the 
common
bile duct. Biliary sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 
o'clock
position using a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire. 
Minor
bleeding at the sphincterotomy site was noted. No stones were
seen on balloon sweeps. View was limited on the initial sweep 
due
to minor sphincterotomy site bleeing. 
The site was injected with ___ epinephrine X 5 cc with
effective hemostasis. Occlusion cholangiogram was normal with no
filling defects or strictures. A 5cm by ___ double ___
biliary stent was placed successfully. The pancreatic duct was
filled with contrast and well visualized throughout. The course
and caliber of the duct are normal with no evidence of filling
defects, masses, chronic pancreatitis or other abnormalities

Conclusions   
PreBypass
 No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left 
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular 
cavity is moderately dilated. There is moderate regional left 
ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior and inferolateral 
hypokinesis. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion 
are normal. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic 
aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There 
is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. 
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate 
(___) mitral regurgitation is seen with restricted posterior 
mitral leaflet. There is no pericardial effusion. These findings 
were discussed with Dr. ___ at the time of exam in the 
operating room.

 PostBypass
 The patient is A paced on a phenylephrine infusion. No new 
regional wall motion abnormalities. EF is 40 - 45%. Mitral

Imaging:
================
 
CTA chest ___
1. No dissection, acute aortic injury, or pulmonary embolism.
2. Dense aortic arch and coronary artery calcifications
3. 3-mm right lower lobe pulmonary nodule (4:148). If there is 
high risk of cancer, f/u may be obtained at 12 months; 
otherwise, no f/u is necessary.
4. Numerous calcified pleural plaques. 
   
ETT (___) with ECHO:  
Anginal type symptoms with borderline ischemic EKG changes at a 
high cardiac demand and good functional capacity. Resting 
systolic hypertension with blunted hemodynamic response to 
physiologic stress. Echo report sent separately. Patient 
transferred to ED for further evaluation. Dr. ___. 
 
The patient exercised for 8 minutes 45 seconds according to a 
___ treadmill protocol ___ METS) reaching a peak heart rate 
of 129 bpm and a peak blood pressure of 158/56 mmHg. The test 
was stopped because of anginal pain and ST changes (see exercise 
report for details). This level of exercise represents an 
average/good exercise tolerance for age. In response to stress, 
the ECG showed ischemic ST changes in the setting of abnormal 
resting ECG (see exercise report for details). Resting systolic 
hypertension with blunted blood pressure response to stress. 
There was a blunted heart rate response to stress [beta 
blockade]. 
 
Resting images were acquired at a heart rate of 105 bpm and a 
blood pressure of 158/68 mmHg. These demonstrated normal left 
ventricular cavity size and regional/global systolic function. 
Right ventricular free wall motion is normal. There is no 
pericardial effusion. The ascending aorta diameter is normal. No 
dissection flap is suggested by 2D or color flow Doppler (does 
not exclude). Doppler demonstrated severe aortic regurgitation 
and mild mitral regurgitation with no aortic stenosis or 
significant resting LVOT gradient. 
Echo images were acquired within 58 seconds after peak stress at 
heart rates of 125 - 112 bpm. These demonstrated appropriate 
augmentation of all segments. 
 
IMPRESSION: Good functional exercise capacity. Borderline 
ischemic ST changes with 2D echocardiographic evidence of severe 
resting aortic regurgitation and no inducible wall motion 
abnormalities. Blunted heart rate and blood pressure response to 
exercise. Severe aortic regurgitation at rest. Mild mitral 
regurgitation at rest. 
If clinically indicated, a thoracic CT/MR or TEE is suggested to 
evaluate for possible aortic dissection. A TEE would be best 
able to assess the aortic valve for possible vegetations.  

TTE ___:
The left atrium is normal in size. The left ventricular cavity 
size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. 
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). 
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 
The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is 
mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). Moderate to 
severe (3+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild (1+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

some blood-tinged sputum intermittently.  He notes a subjective
fever as well as sweating and chills but did not take his
temperature at home.  Patient notes that she had some pleuritic
right flank pain that has been persistent for the last 5 days 
and
is worse with deep inspiration and with movement.  It is 
somewhat
tender to palpation.  The patient denies any diarrhea or
constipation or abdominal pain other than the flank pain noted
above.  He has been intermittently taking n.p.o. but notes
significant decrease over the last week.  Patient notes that his
last CD4 count was just over 200 and that he has recently

Lower lung volumes exaggerates the severity of new pulmonary 
edema.  Moderate cardiomegaly is stable but pulmonary 
vasculature and mediastinal veins are more dilated.  Pleural 
effusion is likely but not large.  No pneumothorax. 
  

Final Report 
EXAMINATION:  CT ABD AND PELVIS WITH CONTRAST 
IMPRESSION:
1. Near pancolitis with relative sparing of the cecum, most 
likely infectious 
or inflammatory. 
2. Approximately 50% loss of height at T11, chronicity 
indeterminate. 
3. Note that the left kidney is atrophic. 
 
___ ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY REPORT ___   
Conclusions   
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The 
estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular 
wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are 
normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal 
wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There 
is abnormal septal motion/position. The diameters of aorta at 
the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic 
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic 
valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. 
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. 
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a 
prominent fat pad, although a pericardial effusion cannot be 
excluded with this suboptimal study. No diastolic RV collapse to 
suggest tamponade. Medications On Admission: The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.

history of depression who initially presented from school after
calling crisis line with complaints of worsening depressed and
anxious mood, suicidal thoughts with plan to overdose on
medication. Psychiatry evaluated the patient in the ED and is
planning to admit to inpatient psychiatry. However, she was 
noted
to have WBC 3.2 and ANC .75, so she was admitted to medicine for
further evaluation of neutropenia prior to psychiatry admission.

On my evaluation, the patient reports that she recently had a 
bad
case of the flu. It was diagnosed at the beginning of the month
and she was on 5 days of Tamiflu starting on the ___. She
reported that her symptoms of lightheadedness, fevers, body
aches, and shortness of breath have been slow to improve. She 
has
been on multiple medications including Tylenol, cough syrup, and
albuterol inhaler, among others she can't remember. The symptoms
have sequentially gotten better, but she occasionally still has
to use her albuterol inhaler when she starts coughing. She had
some weight loss during this episode of the flu. She has no 
prior
history of asthma or respiratory diseases. She reports never
getting the flu before. She didn't get the flu shot this year.
She also had one episode of lower abdominal pain last week, 
which
prompted her to go to urgent care. Her workup was unremarkable
and her symptom went away after a few hours. She thinks she may
have been constipated. 

Otherwise she reports no recent illnesses. She takes no chronic
home medications. She eats no red meat but otherwise endorses a
balanced diet. She denies prior sexual intercourse. She denies
any joint pains, rashes, skin/hair/nail changes, fevers/chills 
or
known rheumatologic conditions. She denies cigarette smoking.
Rare marijuana. When she drinks alcohol at parties, she endorses
drinking up to 8 shots, which she says happens about once every
couple weeks and she doesn't drink at all in the interim.

PERTINENT IMAGING:
==================

MRI ___:
IMPRESSION: 
1. Significant interval increase size of an extra-axial frontal 
lobe 
parafalcine lesion, compatible with a meningioma.  Given the 
rapid growth in size am prominent peripheral FLAIR hyperintense 
signal, this could represent an atypical meningioma. 
2. The lesion abuts the superior sagittal sinus without evidence 
of invasion. 
3. No additional lesions are identified. 

ECG ___:  TRACING #4
Sinus arrhythmia. Compared to tracing #3 atrial and ventricular 
premature 
beats are now not seen. T waves are probably improved. 
Otherwise, no change.

Baseline artifact. Probably sinus tachycardia with atrial 
premature beats and a single ventricular premature beat. Left 
anterior fascicular block. Consider voltage for left ventricular 
hypertrophy in leads I and III. Compared to the previous tracing 
heart rate is increased. Atrial premature beats and ventricular 
premature beats are new. Clinical correlation is suggested.

EEG ___:
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous video EEG study as it 
showed the presence of continuous background disorganization 
over the left hemisphere together with continuous focal mixed 
frequency slowing in the left posterior quadrant. These findings 
are indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction which is 
non-specific but may be due to a structural lesion in broadly 
distributed over the left temporal/occipital regions. There were 
no epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures. There 
were no pushbutton activations. 

CT Head ___:
IMPRESSION: 
1. Moderately motion limited exam. 
2. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or large vascular 
territorial infarction.

121/81, R 12, O2 sat 100% on RA. He was given Cipro and Flagyl 
for his diarrhea, given his history of hypogammaglobulinemia. He 
was also given Zofran for his nausea. EKG was unremarkable and 
his first set of troponins were negative. He was found to have a 
creatinine of 2.8, which is increased from his baseline of 0.8, 
so he was given 2L of NS. In addition, his potassium was 2.6, so 
he was given 80 mEq of potassium. Given his acute renal failure, 
he was admitted to medicine for further evaluation. His VS at 
the time of admission were T 98.1 P 78, BP 125/80, R 15 O2 99% 
RA.

IMAGING
___ CT C/A/P:
1. Severe T12 compression fracture with slight retropulsion of 
the superior T2 endplate, indeterminate age. 
2. Multiple fractures of posterior and lateral ___ ribs, 
some of which demonstrate developing callus, suggesting subacute 
chronicity. 
3. Acute appearing right L1 transverse process fracture, and 
probable T10 and T11 spinous process fractures. 
4. Status post aortic bifemoral bypass with complete occlusion 
of right bypass graft. 
5. 3.5 cm fluid collection encasing the left bypass graft in the 
left lower quadrant, likely representing a seroma. 
6. Apparent filling defect in the left common femoral vein, 
likely mixing 
artifact.  However, ultrasound is recommended to evaluate for 
possible DVT. 
7. UIP pattern of pulmonary fibrosis in the bilateral lung 
bases. 
8. Diverticulosis without evidence of acute diverticulitis. 
9. 4.2 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm at the level of the aortic 
hiatus. 

___ L ___:
IMPRESSION:  
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the left lower 
extremity veins. 

___ CT head:
1. Mild left frontal subarachnoid hemorrhage. No prior studies 
available for comparison. 
2. Presumed arachnoid cyst in the left middle cranial fossa. 

___ TTE:
The left atrial volume index is normal. There is no evidence for 
an atrial septal defect by 2D/color Doppler.
The estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. There is mild 
(non-obstructive) hypertrophy of the basal
septum with a normal cavity size. There is normal regional left 
ventricular systolic function. Global left
ventricular systolic function is normal. The visually estimated 
left ventricular ejection fraction is 60%. Left
ventricular cardiac index is normal (>2.5L/min/m2) No 
ventricular septal defect is seen. There is no resting
left ventricular outflow tract gradient. Normal right 
ventricular cavity size with normal free wall motion. The
aortic sinus diameter is normal with normal ascending aorta 
diameter. The aortic arch diameter is normal.
There are simple atheroma in the abdominal aorta. The aortic 
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is
moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.5 cm2). There 
is no aortic regurgitation. The mitral leaflets
are mildly thickened with no mitral valve prolapse. There is 
moderate mitral annular calcification. There is no
mitral valve stenosis. There is mild [1+] mitral regurgitation. 
Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral
regurgitation could be UNDERestimated. The tricuspid valve 
leaflets appear structurally normal. There is trivial
tricuspid regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic 
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Adequate image quality. Moderate low gradient aortic 
stenosis. Normal biventricular systolic
function.

___ XR shoulder/humerus:
1. No fracture or dislocation. 
2. Multiple focal lucencies in the left humeral shaft could

HEAD CT 
1. No definitive acute intracranial abnormality on noncontrast 
head CT.  There 
is no intracranial hemorrhage. 
2. Nonspecific asymmetric hypodensity of the left pons is 
slightly more 
prominent on the current exam, which may be secondary to 
artifact.  If there 
no contraindications, MRI would be more sensitive for acute 
infarcts. 

CT RIGHT SHOULDER 
1.  Minimally displaced right acromion fracture. 
2.  Fracture through the base of the coracoid process with 1.6 
cm of anterior 
distraction of the bony fragment segment.

Evaluation is limited by overlying soft tissues.  No fracture or 
dislocation 
is seen.  There is significant femoroacetabular joint space 
narrowing 
bilaterally, right greater than left.  Evaluation of the sacrum 
is somewhat 
limited by overlying bowel gas.  No radiopaque foreign body 
seen. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
  
Limited evaluation for fracture.  If there is suspicion for 
fracture, 
cross-sectional imaging should be performed. 

RIGHT KNEE X-RAY: 
No fracture or dislocation is detected.  There is narrowing in 
the medial 
compartment.  Chondrocalcinosis is most prominent in the lateral 
compartment. No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesion is 
identified.  No joint effusion is seen.  Vascular calcifications 
are seen.  No radio-opaque foreign body is detected.  The bones 
are demineralized.

== IMAGING ==
-- ___ CXR
No acute cardiopulmonary process. 

-- ___ UNILAT UPPER EXTR ULTRASOUND
No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the left upper extremity.

-- ___ TTE
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right 
atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Regional left 
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular 
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 55%). The estimated 
cardiac index is depressed (<2.0L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler 
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure 
(PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. The right 
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall 
hypokinesis. There is abnormal systolic septal motion/position 
consistent with right ventricular pressure overload. The 
ascending aorta and aortic arch are mildly dilated. The aortic 
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet 
excursion and no aortic stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is 
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There 
is no mitral valve prolapse. There is absent transmitral A wave 
c/w impaired left atrial mechanical function. Mild to moderate 
(___) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary 
artery systolic hypertension. The end-diastolic pulmonic 
regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery 
diastolic hypertension. There is a trivial pericardial effusion. 

 IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
preserved regional and low normal global left ventricular 
systolic function. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. Mildly dilated 
thoracic aorta. Increased PCWP. Absent transmitral A wave.
 The symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with increased PCWP 
and absent transmitral A wave and multivalvular regurgitation 
are suggestive of an infiltrative process (e.g., amyloid). 

-- ___ CARDIAC MRI
The left atrial AP dimension is mildly increased with moderate 
left atrial elongation. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is normal left ventricular wall 
thickness with normal mass. Normal left ventricular
end-diastolic dimension with SEVERELY increased left ventricular 
end-diastolic volume and
moderately increased end-diastolic volume index. There is mild 
global left ventricular hypokinesis with
relative preservation of apical function. The left ventricular 
cardiac index is normal. There is uniformity
in regional T2. Early gadolinium enhancement images showed no 
enhancement. There is no late
gadolinium enhancement (absence of scar/fibrosis). Mildly 
increased right ventricular end-diastolic volume
index with mild global free wall hypokinesis and low normal 
ejection fraction. Normal origin of the
right and left main coronary arteries. Mildly increased 
ascending aorta diameter (normal BSA indexed
ascending aorta diameter) with normal aortic arch diameter and 
mIldly dilated descending thoracic aorta
(normal BSA indexed descending aorta diameter). Mildly increased 
abdominal aorta diameter (normal
BSA indexed abdominal aorta diameter). Moderately increased 
pulmonary artery diameter with mildly
increased BSA indexed PA diameter. The # of aortic valve 
leaflets could not be determined. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Mild aortic regurgitation is seen. There 
is moderate mitral regurgitation. There is
moderate tricuspid regurgitation. There is a small 
circumferential pericardial effusion. Pericardial thickness
is normal. There is a small right pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular wall thickness and global 
mass. Moderately dilated left ventricular
cavity with mild global hypokinesis. No evidence of myocardial 
edema, inflammation, infiltration
or scar/fibrosis. Mildly dilated right ventricular cavity with 
low normal free wall motion. Moderate mitral
regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
These findings are most c/w a non-ischemic dilated 
cardiomyopathy.

matched related donor, currently D+120 with recent anemia 
requiring transfusion and bone marrow biopsy concerning for pure 
red cell aplasia as well as Afib not on coumadin who presents 
after presyncopal episode this morning. 

Pt states that this morning he was standing up in the kitchen 
when he began to feel lightheaded like he was going to faint. He 
noted flashes of color across his vision. This lasted for 
several minutes. No associated chest pain, palpitations, SOB or 
diaphoresis. After sitting down he felt the urge to have a bowel 
movement. He went to the bathroom and had a bowel movement with 
relief of his symptoms. BM was large but nonbloody, no melena. 
No associated fever, chills, N/V, abdominal pain or diarrhea. 
Notes urine output in excess of intake over past several days 
with normal appetite. Only other recent symptom is nonproductive 
cough. No sick contacts or recent travel. Has been taking his 
medications as prescribed. He called his doctor and was 
instructed to come to the ED for evaluation. 

Of note, he was diagnosed with MDS in the setting of multifocal 
pneumonia and WBC count of 47. Bone marrow biopsy in ___ 
showed changes consistent with MDS RAEB -2. He is s/p 4 cycles 
of decitabine with a decrease from 10% to 7% blasts in his 
marrow and normalization of his WBC, which was initially 47k. He 
decided to proceed with an elective allo-transplant with a MRD 
___ match from his brother with a reduced-intensity 
non-myeloablative transplant with Flu/BU conditioning regimen 
with day 0 on ___. Over the last several months he has been 
noted to have persistent anemia with absence of red cell 
precursors consistent with pure red cell aplasia based on bone 
marrow biopsy. He was treated with transfusions requiring about 
a unit a week, most recently on ___. His cyclosporine was 
tapered until discontinuation on ___. During his most recent 
clinic visit with Dr. ___ on ___ plan had been to monitor 
for improvement in cell count after discontinuation of 
immunosuppression then consider pheresis and/or rituximab. He 
was also noted to have developed tingling and pruritus 
concerning for GVH of the skin soon after discontinuation of 
immunosuppression. He was treated with benedryl and hydroxyzine 
as an outpatient. 

On arrival to the ED, his initial VS were 98.7 86 104/69 16 99%. 
Orthostatics were negative. Initial workup revealed CBC w/ WBC

putamen, globus pallidus, as well as diffusion restriction ___ 
multiple areas of cortex as per prior MR.  ___ that time, there 
is some increase ___ IVH, small amount of SCh which was new ___ 
the right frontal region.
An angiogram on ___ was negative for source of IVH or mycotic 
aneurysm, neurosurgery evaluated and thought the subarachnoid 
was likely procedural given the poor placement; they believe 
that the IVH was due to coagulopathy of DIC.

CT ABDOMEN: 

The imaged lung bases demonstrate bibasilar dependent 
atelectasis without
pleural effusions.  Heart is top normal in size without 
pericardial effusion. 
Small hiatal hernia is noted.
 
The liver demonstrates homogeneous enhancement without 
suspicious focal
lesions.  There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic 
biliary ductal
dilatation.  The gallbladder is incompletely distended.  There 
is no
gallbladder wall edema or pericholecystic fluid collection to 
suggest acute
inflammation.  No calcified gallstones are seen within its 
lumen.  The spleen
is unremarkable.  The pancreas enhances homogeneously without 
ductal
dilatation or peripancreatic fluid collection.  The adrenal 
glands are normal.
The kidneys enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically without 
evidence of
hydronephrosis or renal masses.  Multiple renal hypodensities 
bilaterally are
too small to characterize and are likely cysts.  The largest 
hypodense lesion
arising from the lower pole of the left kidney measures 5.1 x 
4.8 cm with 12
Hounsfield units in attenuation, compatible with a simple cyst, 
unchanged.
 
The small and large bowel loops are normal in caliber without 
evidence of
bowel wall thickening or obstruction.  The appendix is not 
visualized;
however, there are no secondary signs to suggest inflammation in 
the right
lower abdomen.  There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal 
lymphadenopathy. 
The imaged intra-abdominal aorta and its branches demonstrate 
moderately
severe calcified atherosclerotic disease.  Infrarenal aorta 
measures 2.8 cm in
maximum dimension, with stable-appearing focal dissection.
 
CT OF THE PELVIS:  The bladder, distal ureters, rectum and 
sigmoid colon are
unremarkable.  The prostate gland appears enlarged.  There is no 
free air or
free fluid within the pelvis.  Post-surgical changes related to 
bilateral
inguinal hernia repair are noted.  There is no pelvic wall or 
inguinal
lymphadenopathy.
 
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  No suspicious lytic or sclerotic bony 
lesion is seen.
 
IMPRESSION:
1.  No acute CT findings to account for the patient's clinical 
presentation.
 
2.  Calcified atherosclerotic disease of the aorta.  Stable 
appearance of the
dilated infrarenal aorta measuring 2.8 cm in maximum dimension 
with stable
focal dissection.
 
3.  Bilateral renal hypodensities, most compatible with cysts.
 
4.  Small hiatal hernia.
.
CXR: 
FINDINGS:
Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung 
volumes.  There is
no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  A 
6-mm nodular
opacity projecting over the right upper lung is stable since 
priors.  Hilar
and mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged.  The descending aorta 
appears
tortuous.  Heart size is top normal.  Perihilar vascular 
congestion is noted.

___ year history of chronic back pain and MRI-evidence of L5-S1 
disc bulge with impingement of the S1-S2 nerve roots who 
initially presented to the ED on ___ with a week long history 
of progressively worsening right-sided lower back pain. The 
patient had received a steroid injection for back pain 
approximately 2.5 weeks prior to presentation to the ED. He 
initially acheived some relief with the steroid injfection, but 
over the week prior to presentation to the ED, he experienced 
gradually worsening right-sided back pain radiating to right 
anterior and posterior thighs. The pain progressed to the point 
where it woke him up at night. He was takin motrin for pain 
relief, but was unable to acheive adequate pain cotnrol. He was 
seen at an OSH ED twice during that week but was ultimatly 
referred to the ___ ED by his orthopedist. He denied any 
fevers or chills or changes in bowel or bladder habits at that 
time.
.
In the ED on ___, his initial vitals were Temp: 97, HR: 103, 
BP: 133/80, RR: 20, O2Sat: 97% RA. He was seen by Ortho-Spine 
who noted no focal weakness or focal tenderness on exam. They 
did note, however, poor effort in all aspects of the lower 
extremity exam, with 
generalized give-away weakness but no pain with range of motion 
of hips, knees, or ankles. He was noted to have a steady gait, 
limited only by pain, with no focal neurological defecits and no 
sign of spinal cord involvement. He was discharged home with a 
lidocaine patch and a follow-up appointment with orthopedics.
.
That night, however, the patient returned to the ED with 
worsening back pain, significant right groin pain, and pain with 
hip movement. The patient also reported RLE weakness, numbness 
and tingling down the right buttocks, difficulty walking, and an 
episod of urinary incontinence. His initial vitals at this ED 
visit were Temp: 99.6,  HR: 108, BP:139/96, RR :18, O2Sat: 96% 
on RA. During this ED visit, he was noted to have a temperature 
of 101 and a WBC of 14.9. The Ortho-Spine team was again 
consulted and reported weakness of right hip flexion, mostly 
limited by pain, but no sensory/motor deficits of either lower 
extremity.
.
An MRI was obtained which was notable for a loculated, 6.4 x 5.0 
cm, fluid collection within the right iliopsoas, concerning for 
an abscess. Moderate degenerative changes of the lumbar spine 
particularly at L5-S1 were also noted. Follow-up CT-scan of the 
abdomen and pelvis was notable for right iliacus and iliopsoas 
abscesses with inflammatory changes extending to the 
cecum/ascending colon. The inflammation did not surround the 
bowel, however, and there was no significant bowel wall 
thickening. The patient was seen by ACS who subsequently 
admitted the patient on ___. He was initially started on 
broad spectrum antibioitcs (vancomycin, levofloxacin, and 
flagyl) and blood cultures were sent. Blood cultures were 
positive for pan-sensitive staph aureus, and he was subsequently 
switched to nafcillin. The patient was maintained on nafcillin 
but his pain did not improve and his WBC remained elevated. Past Medical History: Chronic low back pain s/p fall down a flight of stairs

disorganized background throughout the recording with intermixed 
generalized
slowing and brief periods of voltage attenuation. These findings 
are
indicative of a moderate to severe diffuse encephalopathy which 
implies
widespread cerebral dysfunction but is non-specific as to 
etiology. No focal
or epileptiform features were noted at any time. Episodes of 
repeated mouth
and tongue movements seen on video were not associated with any 
change on EEG.

has resulted
___ shift of the mediastinum to the right.  Bronchoscopy 
recommended.
2.  No pulmonary embolus.  
3.  Enlargement of the main pulmonary artery is compatible with 
underlying
pulmonary hypertension.  
4.  Mediastinal lymphadenopathy of indeterminate etiology.
 
ECHO ___:
Suboptimal image quality.The left atrium is mildly dilated. No 
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left 
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular 
cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a 
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall 
left ventricular systolic function is preserved (LVEF>50%). 
There is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular 
free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is 
markedly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The

___ CT ABD AND PELVIS WITH ORAL AND IV CONTRAST
INDICATION:  ___ man with bloody stools, evaluate for 
colitis or 
source of acute bleed. 
COMPARISON:  None. 
TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial MDCT images through the abdomen and 
pelvis with oral (Volumen)and intravenous contrast, with 
multiplanar reformats. 
FINDINGS: 
Lung bases are clear.  There is no pleural effusion.  Liver 
enhances 
homogenously without focal lesions.  Gallbladder, spleen, 
pancreas, and 
adrenal glands are within normal limits.  Kidneys enhance 
symmetrically 
without focal lesion or hydronephrosis. 
Stomach is distended with oral contrast but does not show wall 
thickening.  The duodenal sweep is unremarkable.  Proximal loops 
of small bowel are distended with oral contrast but do not show 
wall thickening or signs of obstruction.  Distal small bowel 
loops are less distended.  Prominent enhancement of the colon, 
ascending colon in particular, may relate to the phase of 
contrast; however, there is also mild thickening of the colonic 
wall and minimal fat stranding which could reflect colitis. The 
appendix is normal. 
There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  
There is no 
intra-abdominal free fluid or free air. 
Bladder, seminal vesicles, and prostate are unremarkable.  There 
is no pelvic free fluid.  There is no inguinal or pelvic 
lymphadenopathy. 
Osseous structures are unremarkable. 
IMPRESSION:   
Mucosal hyperenhancement in the ascending colon with mild wall 
thickening and minimal stranding may represent mild colitis.

presenting with one week of abdominal pain, bloody stools, 
diarrhea, and tenemsus, with mild ascending colitis on CT scan.

# Acute colitis. Initially, he presented with bloody diarrhea 
for one week. He ad no family history of IBD, no prior GI 
history, no recent travel, no recent antibiotic use, and no 
sexual risk factors. He denied any anal intercourse. He was 
initially guaiac positive in the ___ on his first presentation, 
but was then negative the next day in the ___ and on admission to 
the floor. He was treated with IV fluids and IV ciprofloxacin 
pending stool studies. However, all stool studies were negative 
including C.diff, stool culture, Campylobacter, Salmonella, 
Shigella, and EHEC. He continued to have about 5 bouts of 
diarrhea a day, some watery brown and some with blood streaks. 
He was treated with oxycodone and Zofran for abdominal pain and 
nausea. Given his ongoing symptoms, GI was consulted. Reviewing 
the CT, he had some distention in the proximal small bowel and 
colitis only in the ascending colon, narrowing the differential 
to Yersinia vs Crohn's. Stool cultures have remained negative 
but Yersinia was pending at time of discharge. Patient was 
started on ciprofloxacin to complete total of 14 days (day 
___, last dose ___. By day of discharge, patient was 
tolerating a low residue, lactose free diet with decreased 
sugars without vomiting. He is to f/u with GI outpatient for 
further evaluation re: colonoscopy. He complains of abdominal 
pain but this is likely component of colitis in addition to

colitis on CT and leukocytosis to 27, and admitted for workup 
and
IV antibiotics.

Per her report, she was diagnosed with "hemorrhagic ___ in
her ___ and nothing initially could control the bleeding; she
required a partial resection.  She eventually went into a
___ admission, developing abdominal pain and cramping in
___.  She was initially diagnosed with diverticulitis but
on CT scan was found to have colitis.  She had a 5 day admission
to ___ at this time, for abdominal pain and symptomatic
hypotension. At the end of ___ she underwent a colonoscopy which
showed chronic severely active colitis with ulceration, which 
was
negative for CMV.  She was started on Humira the beginning of
___. 

The morning of admission, she woke up feeling lightheaded and

5. Two lung nodules measuring up to 5 mm along the left fissure.

___- CXR
Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar 
contours are
unremarkable.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  
Elevation of the
right hemidiaphragm is of indeterminate chronicity.  Patchy 
opacities within
the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis.  No pleural 
effusion or
focal consolidation is noted.  There are no acute osseous 
abnormalities.  No
subdiaphragmatic free air is present.

___
Colonic and small bowel dilatation likely ileus, consider 
cross-sectional
imaging if there is concern for obstruction.

___ Chest Xray
Left basal peribronchial opacification is improved slightly.  
Right
hemidiaphragm remains severely elevated and is responsible for 
new right
middle lobe atelectasis.  Upper lungs are clear.  Heart size is 
normal.

filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The right ventricular free wall 
thickness is normal. Right ventricular chamber size is normal 
with normal free wall contractility. The diameters of aorta at 
the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic 
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet 
excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally 
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The left ventricular 
inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. There is borderline 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial 
effusion.

IMAGING
___ CXR PA/LAT
The no previous images.  The cardiac silhouette is at the upper 
limits of 
normal in size.  There is some indistinctness of pulmonary 
markings, raising the possibility of elevation of pulmonary 
venous pressure.  However, no evidence of pleural effusion or 
acute focal pneumonia. 

___ RUQ U/S DOPPLER
1. Patent hepatic vasculature. 
2. Coarse nodular hepatic architecture, with splenomegaly and 
ascites, 
consistent with cirrhosis. 
3. Cholelithiasis with sludge in the gallbladder. 

___ CT ABD W/W/O CONTRAST
1. Liver cirrhosis without focal lesion. 
2. Patent arterial and portal venous vasculature.  Accessory 
right hepatic artery arising from the superior mesenteric 
artery. 
3. Sequelae of portal hypertension, including extensive varices, 
splenomegaly and large volume ascites are stable. 
4. Please refer to separately dictated chest CT report of same 
date for 
evaluation of thoracic findings. 

___ CT CHEST 
1.  No concerning pulmonary mass or consolidation.  Bilateral 
pulmonary 
nodules measuring up to 3 mm.  In a patient with risk factors 
for lung cancer, follow-up with chest CT would be recommended in 
___ year.  If the patient is low risk for lung cancer, no further Medications On Admission: thought likely 
secondary to SBP. Initially this was responsive to albumin, but 
subsequently worsened with concern for development of 
hepatorenal syndrome. She became anuric and volume overloaded 
with worsening lower extremity edema, ascites, and pulmonary 
edema. She was transferred to MICU.

#Respiratory failure: Patient had some shortness of breath on 
admission which was improved substantially with nebulizer 
treatments. After receiving FFP and platelets prior to a 
paracentesis, her shortness of breath worsened with crackles on 
exam. This progress as renal function worsened with icnreased 
work of breathing, and new O2 requirement. TTE was done which 
did not show any diastolic/systolic dysfunction.

#Anemia: Patient presented with anemia and concern for 
hemolysis/DIC versus bleeding into a known rectus sheath 
hematoma at outside hospital. Labs were concerning for DIC with 
low haptoglobin and fibrinogen; however these values were felt 
more likely to be explained by her underlying liver disease. 
Rectus sheath hematoma was followed on imaging and did not show 
expansion. Her hemoglobin subsequently stabilized.

#Hyperkalemia: Patient presented with hyperkalemia to 6.2 at 
outside hospital, as well as in house. ECG was followed and did 
not show changes. She was treated with kayexelate wtih good 
improvement. 

#Adrenal insufficiency: Because patient had hyperkalemia and 
hyponatremia, there was concern for adrenal insufficiency. ___ 
stim test revealed inadequate response. Endocrinology were 
consulted and recommended further workup given concern that 
patient's liver disease may lead to erroneous ___ stim test 
because of impaired synthesis of cortisol binding globulin. As 
patient's clinical status worsened, however, this was not 
performed.

#T2DM: Uncontrolled, A1c 9.0. She was continued on long acting 
and sliding scale insulin in house.

#Hyponatremia: Thought likely secondary to liver failure and 
acute renal failure with prerenal presentation. Sodium level was 
followed.

MICU COURSE
=============
___ yo woman with NASH cirrhosis (Class C, c/b ascites, SBP, no 
known varices), DM2, who presents as transfer from OSH with 
decompensated cirrhosis c/b SBP, bacteremia, and anemia, 
transferred to ___ for liver transplant evaluation and 
subsequently to the MICU for respiratory distress due to altered 
mental status and potential dialysis 

#RESPIRATORY COMRPOMISE: Ms. ___ presented with acute 
respiratory compromise in the setting of worsening obtundation. 
Her tachypnea was likely multifactorial secondary to 
hypervolemia in setting of anuria and worsening abdominal 
distension with ascites that may be compressing the diaphragm. 
Her recent pulmonary edema, potentially secondary to TRALI, is 
likely also contributing. Given this presentation in combination 
with her obtundation patient was intubated for airway 
protection. The patient continued to be intubated throughout her 
MICU course. 

#CIRRHOSIS C/B ASCITES, SBP and ABDOMINAL DISTENSION: Ms. 
___ presented with known cirrhosis complicated by SBP early 
in her course s/p 14-days of CTX as well as ciprofloxacin PPX 
that was initiated on ___ after arrival to ___. Recently 
she had worsening abdominal distension that may be secondary to 
a gastric outlet obstruction that is either functional or less 
likely, anatomic. Patient was started on meropenem given 
potential SBP. The patient continued to worsen during her MICU 
stay with increasing lactate levels, hypotension, and continued 
altered mental status. After discussions with the physicians 
given the patient's poor prognosis, the family of the patient 
including her health care proxy chose ___ measures only. All 
non-essential medications were discontinued including 
antibiotics. The patient continued to deteriorate with worsening 
lactate, anuria, and hypotension. The patient passed away due to 
the complications of her liver disease. 

#ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Patient without very clear 
evidence of worsening creatinine however became anuric with 
increasing creatinine. Patient was in renal failure and in need 
of dialysis. The plan was to initiate hemodialysis but given the 
poor prognosis the patient's family switched goals of care to 
comfort measures only. 

#Ileus - patient continued to be without bowel movements over 
the course of her MICU stay. The OG tube was suctioned daily 
with eventually feculent material being extracted. A CT abdomen 
showed colonic ileus related to
ischemic changes vs. Oglivies which could have been contributing 
to her clinical status and worsening lactate. Given the poor 
prognosis no intervention was pursued.  

#COAGULOPATHY W/ CONCERN FOR ACTIVE BLEEDING: The patient had 
bright red blood at her posterior pharynx noticed during 
intubation. ENT was consulted and packed the nasopharyngeal 
pharynx with gauze with resolution of the bleed. The patient's 
INR continued to increase during her ICU stay. 

#ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Ms. ___ presented with obtundation 
that is likely multifactorial secondary to hepatic 
encephalopathy and progressive renal failure. Prior to passing 
the patient experienced ventricular tachycardia with subsequent 
bradycardia and decreased blood pressures. Morphine was 
administered to comfort the patient during her final hours.

cell leukemia in late ___ after presenting with 
hepatosplenomegaly and thrombocytopenia to the emergency room. 
She had follow up with hematology/oncology and Dr. ___ 
diagnosis was confirmed. She underwent placement of a ___ line 
on ___ for initiation of continuous infusion cladribine at 
0.7mg/kg weekly. Early the day prior to this admission she woke 
up with pain at the ___ entry site in her right arm. She had 
been lying on her right side while sleeping. Over the course of 
the day, the pain continued and was worse with movement of the 
arm. It radiated to the right hand and was accompanied by 
numbness and tingling of her fingertips. She felt that the arm 
was slightly more swollen than her left arm, and she sought 
evaluation in the Emergency Department.  
In the ED, a right upper extremity ultrasound revealed no DVT. 
While in the ED, she developed sharp, pressure-like, "tight" 
chest discomfort, substernal, non-radiating, not accompanied by 
nausea, vomiting, and diaphoresis. She does report mild dyspnea 
which she attributes to anxiety. EKG was performed and revealed 
no evidence of ischemia; in addition, a CT scan of the chest 
showed no pulmonary embolus. She was given Percocet for her 
pain, with resolution of her discomfort. She estimates that the 
pain lasted approximately an hour before stopping.

Imaging:
========
ERCP ___
We ordered ___ and Igg4.
EUS/FNB samples sent with rush request.
Further management will depend on path, lab and CT results.
Clear fluids when awake then advance diet as tolerated.
Follow-up with Dr. ___ as previously scheduled.
Follow for response and complications. If any abdominal pain,
fever, jaundice, gastrointestinal bleeding please call Advanced
Endoscopy Fellow on call ___
Repeat ERCP with possible EUS rendez-vous when tissue diagnosis
is confirmed.

ERCP ___
Impression: The scout film was normal. The procedure was 
started
in a short position. The papilla was difficult to localise.
Multiple unsuccessfull attempts were made to cannulate with the
sphincterotome followed by the ___ cannula. At this point, it
was decided to switch to the linear EUS.   
EUS was performed using a linear echoendoscope at ___ MHz
frequency. The head and uncinate pancreas were imaged from the
duodenal bulb and the second / third duodenum. The ill defined
previously described mass was briefly seen. As we advanced the
scope in the D2 position, the major papilla with oozing bile was
clearly identified. 
It was decided to switch back to an ERCP scope. The major
papilla was seen in a distal position in D2, on the lateral rim
of a large ___ diverticulum. The procedure was done 
in
a long position. 
The bile duct was successfully cannulated using a Rx
sphincterotome preloaded with a 0.035in guidewire. Contrast was
injected and there was brisk flow through the ducts. 
Contrast injection showed a single 2 cm long tight stricture at
the level of the middle third CBD. There was significant
post-obstructive dilation of the CBD. The CHD, right and left
main hepatic ducts were not injected. Complete opacification was
not possible because of a very unstable scope position. The CBD
measured up to 12 mm in diameter. 
A biliary sphincterotomy was successfully performed with the
sphincterotome. There was no post-sphincterotomy bleeding. 
A cytology brush was then inserted to obtain specimen from the
mid third CBD stricture which was sent for cytology. 
Subsequently, a ___ x 9cm biliary strait plastic stent (Cotton
___ was successfully placed in the CBD using a preloaded 
OASIS
stent introducer kit. 
Excellent bile and contrast drainage was seen endoscopically and
fluoroscopically.  

Recommendations: 
Return to ward for on going care.
NPO overnight with aggressive IV hydration with LR at 200 cc/hr
If no abdominal pain in the morning, advance diet to clear
liquids and then advance as tolerated
Continue with antibiotics - to complete atleast 5 days
Follow up with cytology reports. Please call Dr. ___ 
___
___ in 10 days for the pathology results.
Patients case will be discussed in ___ and will arrange for
___ pancreas tumor clinic. 
If any abdominal pain, fever, jaundice, gastrointestinal
bleeding please call Advanced Endoscopy Fellow on call
___

CT A/P Second Opinoin ___
1.  Moderate intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary dilation 
extending from the proximal common bile duct without evidence of 
obstructive lesion in the head of the pancreas, compatible with 
known stricture seen on previous MRCP & EUS.  No CT signs of 
malignancy seen. 
2.  Several borderline mesenteric lymph nodes, nonspecific,
likely reactive.   Multiple retroperitoneal and mesenteric 
lymphadenopathy. 
2. 1.4 x 1 cm h cystic lesion in the body of the pancreas and
other multiple hypoattenuating subcentimeter lesions within the
tail, of them causing obstruction of the pancreatic duct, likely 
benign. 
3.  Nonspecific multiple hypodense lesions in the splenic 
parenchyma. 
4.  Multiple cortical renal cysts, the largest measures up to 
5.6

   FLUID CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH. 

   ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH. 

IMAGING: 
CT Head (___): IMPRESSION: Right frontoparietal 
intraparenchymal hemorrhage which appears isolated with minimal 
surrounding edema. 

CXR (___): CONCLUSION: Probable cardiac enlargement with a left 
basal effusion. Right lung is clear. 

CT Head (___): CONCLUSION: Unchanged appearance of right 
frontal hematoma.

Carotid Ultrasound (___): IMPRESSION: 
1. 0% stenosis in the right and left internal carotid arteries. 

CT Torso (___): IMPRESSION: 
1. No thoracic or abdominopelvic malignant process identified. 
2. In the setting of other sequela of prior granulomatous 
exposure, the non-calcified right lung base nodule may represent 
a non-calcified granuloma. However, repeat chest CT in one year 
is recommended if there are risk factors for malignancy (i.e. 
smoking). 

CSF Flow (___): Non-diagnostic study.  Clonality could not be 
assessed in this case due to insufficient numbers of B cells.  
Cell marker analysis was performed, but was non-diagnostic in 
this case due to insufficient numbers of cells for analysis.

CSF Cytology (___): NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS. Lymphocytes, 
monocytes, and few red blood cells. 

TTE (___): The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild 
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size 
and regional/global systolic function (LVEF 65-70%). Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending 
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are 
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
structurally normal. No mitral regurgitation is seen. The left 
ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. 
There is no pericardial effusion. 
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function. 
Diastolic dysfunction. Mild aortic dilation.  

MRI/MRA/MRV (___): IMPRESSION: 
1. No evidence of a mass associated with the right parietal 
lobar hematoma. No evidence of additional hemorrhages to suggest 
amyloid angiopathy. Given the presence of blood products of 
varying chronicity, an underlying cavernoma may be present. 
Since this lesion is not included in the field of view of the 
current MRA, a repeated MRA or CTA should be considered to 
exclude an arteriovenous malformation. If no other source of 
hemorrhage is identified, then a follow-up MRI with contrast 
should be obtained after the resolution of acute/subacute blood 
products.  
2. Diffuse pachymeningeal enhancement, which may be related to 
carcinomatous meningitis, dural lymphoma, infectious 
(tuberculosis, fungal disease, Lyme disease, syphilis, etc.) or 
inflammatory etiologies (sarcoidosis, Wegener's granulomatosis, 
etc.). 
3. No evidence of active venous sinus thrombosis. Focal 
fenestration in the posterior aspect of the superior sagittal 
sinus, which may represent anatomic variation or recanalization 
following a previous thrombosis. 

CTA Head (___): IMPRESSION:  
1. Unchanged appearance of right parietal intraparenchymal 
hemorrhage and a focus of subarachnoid hemorrhage, with maximum 
___ of 9 mm, is seen in the left quadrigeminal plate 
cistern, new since the ___ but in retrospect was 
present on MR dated ___. No significant mass 
effect or acute large vascular territory infarction.  
2. Normal CTA with no evidence for stenosis, aneurysm formation, 
or other 
vascular abnormality. 
3. Normal CT venogram. 
Final Addendum 
On further review of images, the high density focus thought to 
represent SAH in the quadrigeminal plate cistern may also 
represents redistribution of tentorial subdural blood, seen on 
MR dated ___, now seen collected at the margin of the 
tentorium. 

CSF Flow (___): Non-specific T cell dominant lymphoid profile; 
diagnostic immunophenotypic features of involvement by 
non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma are not seen in specimen. 
Correlation with clinical findings is recommended. Flow 
cytometry immunophenotyping may not detect all lymphomas as due 
to topography, sampling or artifacts of sample preparation. 

CSF Cytology (___): NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS. Lymphocytes, 
monocytes and red blood cells. 

CSF Cytology (___): NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS. Increased 
lymphocytes, monocytes and red blood cells. Rare 
hemosiderin-laden macrophages. 

Dural Pathology (___): pending

CT Head (___): IMPRESSION: 
1. Expected post-surgical appearance following right frontal 
approach 
craniotomy and apparent biopsy.

of cardiac disease and prior stroke who presented to the ED with 
new onset dysarthria. 

Per report, he was in his usual state of health around 7pm (his 
last know well time). He then awoke around midnight and noted 
that he was unable to speak clearly. He states that he knew what 
he wanted to say and had no difficulty understanding. He denied 
weakness or numbness. 

He was taken to the ED for evaluation where he had an ___ stroke 
scale of 1 for slight R facial, 1 for mild aphasia and 2 for 
dysarthria (total=4). He was evaluated by CT and CTA and found 
to have no thrombus. Given that he was almost 6 hours out from 
his event IV tPA was not an option. As there was no thrombus 
seen on CTA, his exam findings were limited primarily to 
dysarthria and the time for onset was about 6 hours the decision 
was made to not pursue IA tPA.

He has had prior strokes. His first in ___ was felt to be 
secondary to carotid artery stenosis and required CEA. This 
surgery was complicated by hematoma. He was also noted in the 
past to have intracerebral small vessel disease on MR and on 
cardiac imaging there has been a question of a small septal 
defect. There is some mention of afib and a L atrial appendage 
thrombus in a prior notes but this is not characterize further 
and since these notes he has had multiple cardiac evaluations. 

Per MR has had multiple other strokes including the left corona 
radiata, left centrum semiovale, lacunes in the R 
periventricular ___ as well as R BG, and several small R sided 
infarcts in different vascular territories concerning for 
emboli.

His last neck images were by MRA in ___ and showed a widely 
patent right common and internal carotid arteries in this 
patient as well as less than 40% left ICA stenosis. His last TTE 
was in ___ and showed an EF of 50%, significant pulm regurg, 
his prosthetic valves but no thrombus or septal defect. His last 
A1c was 6.0 in ___ and his last LDL was 108. He has been on 
Zocor 80 for his HLD. 

Mr. ___ has had a long standing problem of chronic back 
pain. He has had lumbar laminectomies with surgical 
complications and has required long-term treatment with various 
analgesics. He is currently taking ASA 325mg TID as this seems 
to be one of the only medications that relieves his pain. 

Additionally, he says that he has vision impairments since prior 
strokes. It is unclear from his records what the deficits is and 
the patients attempts to explain it are limited by dysarthria. 

ROS: limited to Y/N questions but denies headache, diplopia, 
dysarthria, dysphagia, lightheadedness, vertigo, tinnitus or 
hearing difficulty. Denied difficulties comprehending speech.  
Denied focal weakness, numbness, paraesthesia. No bowel or 
bladder incontinence or retention. Denied difficulty with gait.

Pt also pt denied recent fever or chills.  No night sweats or 
recent weight loss or gain. Denied cough, shortness of breath. 
Denied chest pain or tightness, palpitations.  Denied nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain.  No recent 
change in bowel or bladder habits.  No dysuria.  Denied

 - ___: Evaluated by PCP ___ ?umbilical hernia and GI 
distress. On exam, there was no mass that was able to be 
palpated, so an ultrasound  
 was recommended.  
 - ___: The ultrasound showed a 2.9 x 2.3 cm solid 
well-circumscribed mass in the posterior abdomen versus 
retroperitoneum versus pancreatic head with adjacent adenopathy. 
She then underwent an abdominal CT on ___ which 
demonstrated a 2.8 cm mass in the pancreas uncinate process 
suspicious for carcinoma.  
 - ___: She underwent an endoscopic ultrasound showed a 30 
x 30 mm ill-defined mass in the head of the pancreas. The mass 
was hypoechoic and heterogeneous in texture. The borders were 
irregular and poorly defined. Both an FNA and FNB were 
performed, but unfortunately they were nondiagnostic withscant 
parenchymal sampling, stromal fibrosis and atypical ductal cells 
seen. The initial ultrasound showed that the celiac artery 
takeoff and superior mesenteric artery takeoff were not invaded 
by the mass. The mass also did not seem to involve the portal 
vein or a portosplenic confluence; however, it was in close 
proximity to the SMV, though there was an intact interface noted 
at all levels.  
 - ___: She returned for a second endoscopic ultrasound  
 on ___ and this time pathology from this biopsy showed 
 
 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, moderately differentiated.  
 Cytology was also suspicious for malignancy.  
 - ___: She saw Dr. ___ and ___ recommended 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy and CyberKnife.

and PO vancomycin. 

Renal consulted, and thought his ___ was due to ATN. Losartan 
was held at admission. Lasix was initially held but was 
restarted before discharge. He had urinary retention requiring 
foley placement. For evaluation of hypoxia, chest CT scan showed 
pleural effusions. BNP normal. Echocardiogram showed EF 40-45%, 
no change from prior. ___ dopplers were negative and V/Q scan was 
intermediate. Pulmonary consulted, and thought he had low 
likelihood for PE and thus he was not started on 
anticoagulation. The ___ hospital course was also 
complicated by transaminits, checked the day of transfer and 
elevated from admission labs, of unclear etiology. His statin 
was stopped and abd US was unremarkable. 

During his hospital stay he had daily fevers up to 101.3. With 
his first fever, he was given a dose of vancomycin in addition 
to the moxifloxacin, but none since. CT chest showed small 
pleural effusions but nothing concerning for infection. CT 
abdomen/pelvis was negative for infectious source. MRI spine 
without contrast revealed mild prevertebral swelling without 
discitis, osteomyelitis or abscess.  TTE without vegetations. 
Blood and urine cultures were negative. ID consulted at ___, 
and recommended stopping all abx besides PO vancomycin. He 
received his last dose of IV moxifloxacin on ___.

Of note, the patient's ESR and CRP were more elevated this 
admission, 120 and 263 respectively. His ___ was positive at 
1:320 in a mixed pattern--speckled and homogenous. ANCA pending. 
RF negative.

On the floor, he states that he overall feels well. He is having 
chills, but his dyspnea is at baseline. Diarrhea has improved 
substantially since starting the oral vancomycin. He failed a 
voiding trial on admission, with bladder scan revealing 900mL of 
fluid in his bladder. Foley was placed. He was confused on 
arrival. 

At the time of discharge, all Cx have remained negative, still 
no source of infection has surfaced, and the patient has been 
afebrile and otherwise stable for 4 days. He no longer has had 
episodes of diarrhea, and remains on PO Vanco until ___. He 
did have hypoxia with O2 requirement which resolved with one 
dose of Lasix 20 mg IV 24 hrs prior to discharge. The patient 
was evaluated and treated by physical therapy prior to discharge 
and was cleared to return to home with a walker and with his 
wife agreeing to take care of him. Past Medical History: Seizures, remote history, not on medications

PICC line insertion History Of Present Illness: Mrs. ___ is a very nice ___ year-old ___ with 
DM2, HL, HTN, OA and recent diagnosis of B-cell lymphoma 
(non-Hodkin) coming with weakness of both legs and inability to 
walk. She was in her prior state of health until aproximately 1 
month ago when her legs started to swell more than normal 
(left>right). There was no skin rash at this time. She started 
using TEDs (knee-high) without improvement in her symptoms. 
There was no clear precipitant such as change in her diet, 
excercise activity, changes in her medications. She was seen by 
a physician in her PCP's office who sent her to the ED for 
concern of "blockage in the vessels". Work up was negative and 
she was sent home. Then, she was evaluated by PCP two weeks ago 
who was concerned by new rash in the left leg. She was refered 
to dermatology who evaluated her and obtained a skin biopsy. 8 
days ago she was called home and told that the biopsy results 
had shown B-cell lymphoma. She was refered to an oncologist at 
___ who evaluated her 4 days ago and had 
multiple CT scans performed. They had planned to meet 5 days 
from now to further discuss treatment, but most likely was going 
to be some for of chemotherapy including Rituximab.  
.  
Since then, she has had multiple unwitness falls at home. 
Appartently she has not hit her head or lost conciousness. She 
was found in the floor by her health aid, without any loss of 
sphincter control, coherent and EMS were called. They evaluated 
her and recommended going to ED, but she refused. Subsequently, 
she was not feeling good and call her son who was on his way to 
see her. He recommended her to check her sugars and she was too 
weak to walk and get her glucometer, which was only a couple of 
yards away. The family got concerned and brought her to our 
emergency room for further evaluation.  
.  
When EMS arrived she was nauseous and vomitted x1 (bilous). She 
complained of ___ pain in both legs and loss of conciousness. 
She was put on ___ and transfer to a stretcher.She denied 
any CP, SOB, abdominal pain.  
.  
Of note, since she got informed about her cancer diagnosis 8 
days ago family states that she has been mildly confused. She is 
A&O X3 and is able to talk, but she looks worried and 
occasionaly makes comments that ___ make sence. The family 
thinks it is the shock of the news. She has been afebrile, her 
weight has been stable, she denies any night sweats, chills, 
rigors, changes in her bowel movements, tremors, abnormal 
movements, episodes of LOC.  
.  
The initial VS in the ER were: 99.6 80 154/81 16 97% RA. Her VS 
were stable throught the ED visit. She was alert and oriented 
x3, moving all extremities, No cervical spine tenderness. Her 
ECG showed (per ED read) STD III aVF, TWI V1, SR@80. Her labs 
were significant for WBC 8.5, HCT 35.9, PLT 268, Na 127, K 9.0 
(hemolyzed), Cl 92, CO2 27, BUN 30, Cr 1.5 (unkown baseline), 
glucose 129, repeat K 4.0. Her imaging included a CT of the neck 
that only showed degenerative changes, a 2-cm left frontal mass 
with neighboring vasogenic edema and mild neighboring mass 
effect, normal CXR and hip x-rays. Neurosurgery was consulted 
who did not find any focal deficits. Family was NOT interested 
in surgical approach whatsoever. Dilantin was recommended for 
seizure prophylaxis as well as MRI +/-. No comments were made on 
steroids. She is being admited for further work up and 
management of her weakness and mass. Her VS prior to transfer 
were: hr 68 155/57 20 100RA. Past Medical History: Diffuse large B cell lymphoma: Diagnosed ___ ___

      NEGATIVE FOR TOXOPLASMA IgM ANTIBODY BY EIA. 
      INTERPRETATION:  NO ANTIBODY DETECTED. 
      The FDA is advising that the result from any one 
toxoplasma IgM
      commercial test kit should not be used as the sole 
determinant of
      recent toxoplasma infection when screening a pregnant 
patient. 
___:
INDICATION: An ___ female with left leg pain. 
  
COMPARISON: PET/CT available from ___. 
  
TECHNIQUE: Ultrasonography of the left lower extremity. 
  
FINDINGS: Grayscale and color Doppler ultrasonography of the 
left lower 
extremity demonstrates normal flow, compressibility, and 
augmentation of the left common femoral, superficial femoral, 
and popliteal veins. Numerous hypoechoic lesions are present 
throughout the left leg, compatible with known history of 
multiple masses, better viewed on the ___ PET/CT 
examination. The calf veins could not be assessed due to 
multiple soft tissue masses and associated soft tissue swelling. 

IMPRESSION: Calf veins not assessed due to soft tissue mass. 
Otherwise, no 
DVT is seen. 
SPECIMEN: BONE MARROW ASPIRATE AND CORE BIOPSY:

 

DIAGNOSIS:

- NORMOCELLULAR BONE MARROW FOR AGE WITH MATURING TRILINEAGE 
HEMATOPOIESIS.

- NO MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES OF INVOLVEMENT BY LYMPHOMA ARE SEEN, 
SEE NOTE.

CTA Head:
IMPRESSION:  
  
1. Areas of apparently decreased blood flow and blood volume 
with minimal 
increased MTT in the region of edema surrounding the left 
frontal mass lesion is difficult to assess for 
ischemia/infarction in the setting of edema. Small area of 
mildly increased MTT in the right temporal lobe anteriorly 
without significant decrease in blood volume may be artifactual 
or related to a focus of ischemia/infarction . MRI is 
recommended for better assessment. Findings were discussed with 
Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ after the study was performed. 
  
2. Small irregular partially calcified focus in the right lung 
apex 
posteriorly- needs correlation with dedicated chest imaging to 
exclue 
neoplastic etiology though this can relate to granulomatous 
disease. 
  
3. Moderate mucosal thickening in the ethmoid air cells and left 
side of  
sphenoid sinus with aerosolized secretions.  
ECHO:
Conclusions :The left atrium and right atrium are normal in 
cavity size. The estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. 
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal 
cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). 
The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are 
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. 
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). 
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears 
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is 
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no 
pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Mild aortic valve stenosis. 
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved

MRI OF THE BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST 
  
CLINICAL INDICATION: ___ woman with new diagnosis of 
lymphoma, 
admitted with falls and to have a possible brain metastases, 
evaluate for 
lymphoma and leptomeningeal disease. 
  
COMPARISON: Prior head CT dated ___. 
  
TECHNIQUE: Pre-contrast axial and sagittal images were obtained, 
axial FLAIR, axial T2, axial magnetic susceptibility and axial 
diffusion-weighted sequences. The T1-weighted images were 
repeated after the administration of gadolinium contrast in 
axial T1, sagittal MP-RAGE and also multiplanar reconstructions 
were provided. 
  
FINDINGS: On the left frontal subcortical white matter, there is 
an enhancing mass lesion, measuring approximately 21 x 20 mm in 
transverse dimension by  21.5 x 2.0 mm in sagittal projection, 
this lesion demonstrates significant vasogenic edema and mild 
effacement of the sulci at the convexity with minimal shifting 
of the frontal lobe towards the right, there is no evidence of 
hydrocephalus. The T2 and FLAIR sequences, demonstrates multiple 
scattered foci of high signal intensity, distributed in the 
subcortical white matter, which are nonspecific and may reflect 
chronic microvascular ischemic disease.   
No other enhancing lesions are noted throughout the brain, there 
is no 
evidence of abnormal leptomeningeal enhancement to suggest 
meningeal 
infiltration. Normal flow void signal is noted at the major 
vascular 
structures. The diffusion-weighted sequences are normal with no 
evidence of acute or subacute ischemic changes. The mass lesion 
demonstrates moderate restricted diffusion. 
  
The orbits, the paranasal sinuses and the mastoid air cells are 
grossly 
unremarkable. 
  
IMPRESSION: Enhancing mass lesion identified at the subcortical 
white matter of the left frontal lobe as described in detail 
above, possibly representing a metastatic lesion versus a 
primary brain neoplasm, associated with vasogenic edema and 
effacement of the sulci. 
STUDY: MRI of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine. 
  
CLINICAL INDICATION: ___ woman with newly diagnosed 
lymphoma, 
admitted with falls and found to have a possible brain 
metastases, evaluate for leptomeningeal spread or lymphoma. 
  
COMPARISON: Prior CT of the cervical spine dated ___. 
  
MRI OF THE CERVICAL SPINE: 
  
Sagittal T1, T2 and sagittal STIR sequences were obtained, axial 
T2 and 
gradient echo sequences. The T1-weighted images were repeated 
after the 
administration of gadolinium contrast material. 
  
FINDINGS: There is mild straightening and reversal of the normal 
cervical 
lordosis with degenerative anterolisthesis at C4 upon C5 level. 
The signal 
intensity in the spinal cord throughout the cervical spine is 
normal with no evidence of focal or diffuse lesions to indicate 
spinal cord edema or cord expansion. 
  
Multilevel degenerative changes are visualized throughout the 
cervical spine as follows: 
  
At C3/C4 level, bilateral uncovertebral hypertrophy is 
identified, causing 
mild bilateral neural foraminal narrowing, there is no 
significant spinal 
canal stenosis. 
  
C4/C5 demonstrates posterior central disc bulge and bilateral 
uncovertebral hypertrophy, causing anterior thecal sac deformity 
and mild bilateral neural foraminal narrowing. 
  
At C5/C6 level, bilateral uncovertebral hypertrophy is noted and 
also mild 
posterior disc bulge. 
  
C6/C7 level demonstrates posterior disc bulge and bilateral 
uncovertebral 
hypertrophy, left greater than right, causing left side neural 
foraminal 
narrowing (image 35, series 5014). 
  
The visualized paravertebral structures are normal, there is no 
evidence of abnormal enhancement. 
  
IMPRESSION: Multilevel degenerative changes throughout the 
cervical spine as described above, there is no evidence of 
abnormal enhancement or abnormal signal within the cervical 
spinal cord. 
  
MRI OF THE THORACIC SPINE. 
  
The alignment and configuration of the thoracic vertebral bodies 
is normal.  High signal intensity is noted throughout the 
vertebral bodies in the bone marrow, likely consistent with bone 
marrow replacement for fat. 
  
At T2/T3 level, minimal posterior central disc bulge is 
identified with no 
evidence of neural foraminal narrowing or spinal canal stenosis. 

  
From T3/T4 through T8/T9 levels, there are mild posterior disc 
bulges with no evidence of neural foraminal narrowing or 
significant spinal canal stenosis. 
  
Signal intensity throughout the thoracic spinal cord is normal 
and the conus medullaris terminates at the level of T12. There 
is no evidence of abnormal enhancement. 
  
IMPRESSION: Mild multilevel degenerative changes throughout the 
thoracic 
spine as described above, there is no evidence of abnormal 
enhancement. 
  
MRI OF THE LUMBAR SPINE: 
  
There is mild grade 1 anterolisthesis at L4 upon L5 level, 
apparently 
degenerative in nature. At L2/L3 level, there is disc 
desiccation and mild 
posterior disc bulge, causing mild bilateral neural foraminal 
narrowing, there is also mild articular joint facet hypertrophy 
(image 4, series 5002). 
  
At L3/L4 level, there is a prominent posterior disc bulge, 
asymmetric towards the right, causing significant neural 
foraminal narrowing and moderate spinal canal stenosis, there is 
also articular joint facet hypertrophy. The psoas muscle on the 
right, demonstrates a focal lesion, possibly consistent with a 
hematoma, calcification, formally a metastasis in this area 
cannot be completely excluded (image 9, 10, series 5002), this 
lesion measures approximately 19 x 23 mm in transverse 
dimension. 
  
L4-L5 level demonstrates disc degenerative changes with 
posterior broad-based disc bulge, causing anterior thecal sac 
deformity and bilateral neural foraminal narrowing, there is 
also moderate articular joint facet hypertrophy, resulting in 
moderate-to-severe spinal canal stenosis. 
  
L5-S1 level demonstrates posterior disc bulging, causing 
anterior thecal sac deformity and apparently contacting the 
traversing nerve roots bilaterally, there is also moderate 
articular joint facet hypertrophy resulting in moderate spinal 
canal stenosis. There is no evidence of abnormal enhancement to 
indicate leptomeningeal disease. 
  
IMPRESSION: Multilevel degenerative changes throughout the 
cervical, 
thoracic, and lumbar spine as described in detail above. There 
is a focal 
lesion within the right psoas at the level of L3/L4, possibly 
consistent with a hematoma, calcification, formally a metastasis 
in this area cannot be completely excluded. 
  
There is no evidence of abnormal enhancement to indicate 
leptomeningeal 
disease. Diffuse high signal intensity in the bone marrow, 
possibly 
representing bone marrow replacement for fat. 
PET: IMPRESSION: 1. 2-cm intracranial lymphoma metastasis in the 
left frontal lobe. 2. Moderate intramuscular lymphoma disease in 
the left biceps and right psoas 3. Extensive lymphoma disease in 
the left calf with mild regional spread to the left thigh and 
left inguinal nodes. 

BONE MARROW CYTOGENETICS ___
INTERPRETATION:  
No cytogenetic aberrations were identified in 20 
metaphases analyzed from this unstimulated specimen. 
This normal result does not exclude a neoplastic 
proliferation. 
 
Mosaicism and small chromosome anomalies may not be 
detectable using the standard methods employed. 

LENIs ___:
IMPRESSION: Calf veins not assessed due to soft tissue mass. 
Otherwise, no 
DVT is seen. 
CT HEAD ___
IMPRESSION: 
Stable appearance to left frontal lobe mass. No new areas of 
abnormality. 
  
A few hypodense areas are noted in the left temporal lobe, not 
significantly changed from recent CT Head study; however, can be 
better assessed with MR if necessary.  
EEG ___
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG telemetry due to the 
persistent fixed focal slowing in the mixed theta and delta 
frequency 
range in the left frontal temporal region indicative of 
subcortical 
dysfunction. Rare sharp waves were also seen in the left 
temporal 
region phase reversing at F7, which may be indicative of an area 
of 
cortical irritability, but no clear electrographic seizures were 
seen. 
A breach rhythm was also noted in the left frontal temporal area 
likely 
due to a skull defect. Otherwise, the waking background was slow 
and 
disorganized with bursts of generalized slowing indicative of a 
mild to 
moderate encephalopathy. Toxic/metabolic disturbances, 
infections, and 
medication effects are among the most frequent causes of 
encephalopathy. 
CXR ___
IMPRESSION: Right-sided PICC line should be withdrawn 
approximately 3 cm for more optimal positioning. 
EEG ___
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal 24-hour video EEG telemetry due 
to the 
presence of rare epileptiform discharges in the left temporal 
region 
indicative of an area of cortical irritability; however, no 
clear 
electrographic seizures were seen. Focal slowing was also seen 
in the 
same region along with higher amplitude activity due to a breach 
effect 
typically associated with skull defects. The background was 
better 
developed reaching a maximum of 8 Hz during the recording and 
more 
wakeful periods were seen overall. Overall, this record is 
improved 
compared to the previous day. 
MRI HEAD ___
CONCLUSION: 
1. No evidence of a second lesion in the temporal lobe. 
2. Increase in the volume of enhancing material and in 
surrounding edema in the left frontal lobe. This may represent 
tumor progression, or early 
response to radiation. 
CT HEAD ___
IMPRESSION: 
  
In comparison to ___ exam, left frontal vasogenic edema 
appears 
improved. The left frontal hyperdense lesion is not well 
visualized on 
current study, which may be reflective of its reduction in size.

IMAGING AND OTHER STUDIES
CT Abd/Pelvis ___
There is acute sigmoid diverticulitis with multiple loculated 
fluid collections suggestive of abscesses located within the 
pelvis. Based on the position of the collections and the number 
of separate collections, the findings are not amenable to 
percutaneous drainage.

MRI Head ___
1. No acute abnormality identified.
2. Moderate hippocampal atrophy.
3. Fluid in the left middle ear could indicate otitis media.

CXR ___
The lungs are clear. The heart is normal in size. 
Atherosclerotic changes seen in the thoracic aorta. Mild 
spondylosis seen in the thoracic spine.

Head CT ___
No acute abnormality.

___ guided drain ___
Limited preprocedure CT of the pelvis with contrast demonstrates 
multiple loculated fluid collections within the pelvis, similar 
to recent outside CT abdomen and pelvis.  The largest rim 
enhancing collection containing air and measuring approximately 
4.2 x 3.2 cm slightly to the right of the midline was targeted 
for drain placement.  Approximately 13 cc of purulent fluid was  
drained. Additionally there is more free flowing fluid within 
the bilateral pelvis.  Approximately 10 cc of clear yellow 
ascites was aspirated from the right pelvic free fluid.  
1. Successful CT-guided placement of an ___ pigtail 
catheter into the rim enhancing pelvic collection containing 
air. Approximately 13 cc of purulent fluid was drained. Samples 
were sent for microbiology evaluation. As this appeared frankly 
purulent, sample was not submitted for cytology. 
2. Additionally, a sample of loculated right pelvic free fluid 
was aspirated, and appeared to be simple ascites.  This was sent 
for microbiology. Medications On Admission: The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.

K-3.3 Cl-107 HCO3-26 AnGap-___ with PMH Alzheimer's dementia, diabetes, coming from OSH for 
altered mental status, leukocytosis, hypernatermia and 
hyperglycemia likely due to pneumonia.  She was initially 
admitted to the ICU and then transferred to the floor.

# Hypernatremia: She appeared to have hypovolemic hypernatremia 
based on clinical exam findings of dry mucous membranes, 
significant respiratory variation in IVC diameter, and IJ 
collapse with respiratory variation.  This is likely 
multifactorial in the setting of worsening mental status related 
to infection in combination with dementia. Pt was calculated to 
have a free water deficit of ~5L. Her hypernatremia was 
gradually corrected over the course of 2.5 days with ___ NS 
after volume resuscitation with LR.  Her sodium was monitored 
daily and remained within the normal range. Would continue to 
monitor weekly while at rehab and encourage liquid intake.

# HCAP: On presentation, pt had worsening mental status, 
leukocytosis, and CXR c/w possible left lower lobe PNA.  She had 
a new O2 requirement as well.  She was started on vanc, zosyn, 
and azythromycin. She completed an 8 day course on ___.  
PICC was removed prior to discharge.  Over the course of her 
stay in the ICU, her O2 requirement resolved. At discharge she 
was afebrile, oxygen saturation in high ___ on room air 
breathing comfortably, some improving rhonchi at bases. 

# Nutrition/Goals of Care: It was suspected that her subacute 
weight loss is due to her dementia. She was seen by speach and 
swallow who provided diet recommendations. Also recent 
malnutrition due to acute illess. The issue of inadequate 
nutrition in patients with progressive dementia was discussed 
with her son ___. We dicussed adding high calorie supplements 
to her diet and asssitance with feeding. He will consider using 
an appetite stimulant with her outpatient providers. We 
discussed that there is no evidence that tube feeding will 
improve quality or longevity of life, which he recognized saying 
that he had dealt with similar issues with his father's chronic 
progressive illness and ultimately passing. 
DIET: 
Regular; Diabetic/Consistent Carbohydrate Consistency: Pureed 
(dysphagia); Nectar prethickened liquids Supplement: Glucerna 
shake breakfast, lunch, dinner pills crushed in puree. 
Aspiration precautions, please provide assistance with feeding. 

# HTN: Pt was mildly hypotensive on arrival and required volume 
resuscitation; metoprolol was therefore held. These were later 
restarted.

# Depression: she was continued on her home dose of 20mg 
citalopram.

# H/o CVA: She was continued on her home simva 20 and ASA 81.

#Anemia: Patient hematocrit trended down during hospitalization 
to 25. Labs were consistent with anemia of chronic inflammation. 
Hematocrit remained stable at 25. 

Code status: Full code, although son ___ is HCP and 
reconsidering and would continue to address goals of care

BASELINE: Heart Rate:  62. Blood Pressure:  140/80.
 EKG:  Normal sinus rhythm, normal axis, biphasic T-waves in the 
inferior leads.
Protocol:  ___ exercise performance.
     EXERCISE PERFORMANCE:
     Time on treadmill:  7 minutes.
     Max. Heart Rate:  105.
     % Max. Heart Rate:  72%.
     Max. BP:  175/78.
     Rate-Pressure Product:  18,375.
     Mets of Activity:  8.      
     Exercise Tolerance:  Average for age.      
     Reason for Termination:  Fatigue.      
     Symptoms:  At peak stress, the patient developed a high 
sternal chest tightness that resolved by 5 minutes of recovery.  
    
     Exercise EKG:  At 2 minutes into the stress test, the 
patient developed 2 mm downsloping ST-segment depressions with 
associated T-wave inversions in the inferolateral leads that 
persisted until 24 minutes of recovery.      
     Conclusions:
     1. Average exercise tolerance for age.
     2. Normal hemodynamic response to exercise.
     3. Ischemic symptoms.
     4. Ischemic ECG changes.
     5. Echo report sent separately.

Echo Conclusions:
The patient exercised for 7 minutes 0 seconds according to a 
___ treadmill protocol ___ METS) reaching a peak heart rate of 
105 bpm and a peak blood pressure of 175/78 mmHg. The test was 
stopped because of fatigue. This level of exercise represents an 
average exercise tolerance for age. In response to stress, the 
ECG showed ischemic ST changes (see exercise report for 
details). There were normal blood pressure and blunted heart 
rate responses to stress. 
.
Resting images were acquired at a heart rate of 62 bpm and a 
blood pressure of 140/80 mmHg. These demonstrated regional left 
ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal to distal 
inferolateral hypokinesis. (LVEF = 50 %). Right ventricular free 
wall motion is normal. Doppler demonstrated moderate mitral 
regurgitation with no aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation or 
significant resting LVOT gradient. 
Echo images were acquired within 55 seconds after peak stress at 
heart rates of 92 - 105 bpm. Baseline abnormalities persist with 
new hypokinesis of the distal inferior wall and apex . There was 
augmentation of right ventricular free wall motion. 

IMPRESSION: Average functional exercise capacity. Ischemic ECG 
changes and 2D echocardiographic evidence of inducible ischemia 
to achieved workload.

___ CXR PA/LAT: PA and lateral upright chest radiographs 
were reviewed with comparison to ___. Heart size and 
mediastinum are unremarkable.  Interstitial markings are 
prominent but unchanged since the prior study, most likely 
reflecting chronic changes and unlikely to represent

Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. Left 
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular 
cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated. Overall left 
ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%) 
secondary to possible hypokinesis of the infero-lateral wall and 
basal inferior wall (suboptimal image quality). Right

Imaging:
___ CXR:
FINDINGS: The lungs are somewhat low ___ volume without focal 
consolidation,
pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart is stably enlarged 
with 3 lead
pacemaker/defibrillator noted.  No pleural effusion or 
pneumothorax is seen. 
Bilateral lateral pleural thickening is noted, unchanged since 
___.
 
IMPRESSION: Unchanged examination without acute intrathoracic 
process.

___ Echo:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right 
atrial pressure is at least 15 mmHg. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is severely 
dilated. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis 
(LVEF = 10 %). The right ventricular free wall thickness is 
normal. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed 
free wall contractility. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, 
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets 
(3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No 
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Severe (4+) 
mitral regurgitation is seen. Severe [4+] tricuspid 
regurgitation is seen. There is at least moderate pulmonary 
artery systolic hypertension. ___ the setting of at least 
moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to 
a very high right atrial pressure.] The end-diastolic pulmonic 
regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery 
diastolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. There 
is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent 
fat pad.

Marked left ventricular mechanical dyssynchrony is present. 
However, marked ventricular interaction with reverse Bernheim 
phenomenon is also seen, due to marked right ventricular 
pressure and volume overload.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
both ventricles are even more dilated, and severe mitral and 
tricuspid regurgitation are now present. Mechanical left 
ventricular dyssynchrony remains evident.

___ Right Heart Cath:
COMMENTS:     
1. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left heart 
filling
pressures.  The RA mean pressure was 22 mmHg, mean PCW 31 mmHg.  
The
cardiac index calculated using the Fick equation was 1.57 
l/min/m2.
 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:    
1. Elevated right and left heart filling pressures.
2. Low cardiac index.

___ 10:17AM Echo:
The estimated right atrial pressure is at least 15 mmHg. Left 
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular 
cavity is severely dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic 
function is profoundly depressed (LVEF = 10%). Significant left 
ventricular mechanical dyssynchrony is present (posterior wall 
remains the site of latest activation). The right ventricular 
free wall thickness is normal. The right ventricular cavity is 
dilated with depressed free wall contractility. Moderate (2+) 
mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid 
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial 
effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) 
of ___, the appearance of mitral and tricuspid 
regurgitation is reduced. Marked left ventricular dyssynchrony 
persists. Right ventricular function appears similar.  

___ 3:34PM Echo:
The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated. Overall left 
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF = 15 
%). [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of tricuspid 
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) 
of ___, the overall left ventricular ejection 
fraction is increased as a result of reduced mechanical 
dyssynchrony  

___ CXR:
CONCLUSION:
1.  There is no pneumothorax.
2.  Right-sided PICC line is still looped inside the subclavian 
vein.
3.  Unchanged bibasilar consolidation.

___ CXR:
FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the gastric 
distention has decreased.  There is unchanged evidence of low 
lung volumes with areas of atelectasis at the lung bases.  The 
ECG cables, pacemaker wires and right PICC line are constant.  
Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly.  No new parenchymal opacities

hyperparathyroidism s/p resection, wet macular degeneration s/p 
laser photocoagulation (legally blind), who is referred from 
___ with progressive functional and cognitive decline and 
findings of dehydration.

History mostly obtained from ___ three daughters at 
bedside. Per daughters, patient was at her usual state of health 
until about 6 months ago when she began to slowly decline in her 
functional status. Previously she was ambulatory, conversational 
with family members and tolerating three meals a day. Over the 
past 6 months, she has become increasingly bedbound mostly due 
to lack of motivation, with very poor appetite (only taking 1 
ensure daily often) with lack of interest in previously 
pleasurable activities including socializing with family and 
reading the news. Daughters also endorse underlying chronic 
social anxiety (refused to let repairmen in to fix her home of 
many years). Given this ongoing decline, PCP had conducted ___ 
MMSE in ___ and per report pt scored ___. Her decline has 
been associated with about 20lb weight loss, occasional diarrhea 
for past 3 months, and intermittent periods of acute confusion, 
disorientation and hallucinations (does not recognize family 
members, thinks she is talking to deceased family members). 
Daughters also think she often chokes and coughs after 
swallowing her food. Most recently seen in PCP office this week, 
basic labs, UA done which were per report unremarkable. Also 
given borderline SBP in ___ in office, PCP stopped ___ 
beta blocker. On ROS, endorsed left arm pain, otherwise denied 
fever, chills, shortness of breath. SHe had been up to date with 
mammograms and colonoscopies with no remarkable findings per 
report.

Relevant Imaging:
-----------------
TTE ___:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial 
pressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and 
cavity size are normal. Overall left ventricular systolic 
function is moderately depressed (LVEF= ? 35-40% - assessment 
limited by suboptimal image quality and significant beat to beat 
variability). There is hypokinesis of the mid-distal LV segments 
and apex. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The number of aortic valve 
leaflets cannot be determined. There is mild aortic valve 
stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic regurgitation is 
seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial 
mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure 
could not be determined. There is a trivial/physiologic 
pericardial effusion. 

Compared with the prior focused study (images reviewed) of 
___, left ventricular systolic function is probably 
similar, although suboptimal image quality of both studies 
precludes definite comparison.  

___ CXR
 
IMPRESSION:  
  
Generalized improvement in both lungs is probably due to 
decrease in pulmonary 
edema, now mild, and decrease in previous moderate right pleural 
effusion.  
There is still substantial consolidation in the right upper lobe 
probably 
pneumonia but the bilateral lower lobe components have improved. 
 Heart size 
top-normal.  No pneumothorax.

annuloplasty ring is present. The mitral annular ring appears 
well seated with normal gradient. Moderate [2+] tricuspid 
regurgitation is seen. There is mild-moderate pulmonary artery 
systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is 
seen. The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is 
increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension. 
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

back pain and chest pain following a crossfit work-out and was 
found to have a dissection of the abdominal aorta in addition to 
new q waves on EKG and a mildly elevated troponin. The patient 
reports that he had a strenuous work-out the morning of 
admission. At home, shortly following the work-out, he 
experienced acute onset back pain across his back below the 
clavicle. This was associated with a cold sweat. The pain did 
not subside and when the patient tried to climb his stairs at 
home, he felt extremely week and thus presented to the ___ at 
___. Upon presentation his back pain began to subside 
but he did begin to experience some mild central chest pain. 

At the ___, he was hemodynamically stable. An EKG was 
obtained which demonstrated new inferior q waves and a troponin 
was measured at 0.04. A CTA was obtained which demonstrated an 
abdominal aortic dissection of the infrarenal aorta. He was 
therefore transferred to ___ for further care. 

Here CT repeated â still no ascending dissection.  Overnight 
echocardiogram poor quality, no obvious WMA.  This morningâs 
echo showed slight inferior HK.  Cardiac biomarkers rising and 
pt noted to have Q waves with slight STEs inferiorly. 

He went to cath and was found to have a RCA lesion. He had a 
thrombectomy with no stent and has a 50% residual distal RCA 
stenosis. Admitted to the CCU for further monitoring.

Vitals on transfer were: T  98.2, HR 63, BP 123/71, RR 21, 99% 
RA.

On the floor, patient reports that he feels "great" with no 
chest pain, back pain, shoulder pain or SOB. Only complaint is 
of mild lower abdominal dull pain. Past Medical History: PCP ___ ___ EKG with first-degree heart block sinus 
bradycardia, pt is asymptomatic, no further actions

___ CARDIAC CATH ___:
The coronary circulation is right dominant. 
- Left main: normal
- Ostial LAD: there was a discrete 60% stenosis
- Circumflex: Angiography showed minor luminal irregularities
- ___ obtuse marginal: The vessel was small sized. There was a 
discrete 95% stenosis at the ostium of the vessel segment.
- Proximal ramus intermedius. There was a diffuse 20% stenosis 
at the site of a prior stent.
- Mid RCA: There was a 0% stenosis at the site of a prior stent. 
In a second lesion, there was a tubular 20% stenosis.

Lesion Intervention: A percutaneous intervention was performed 
on the 60% lesion in the proximal LAD. Following intervention 
there was a 60% residual stenosis. This was an ACC/AHA "non-high 
risk" lesion for intervention. There was TIMI 3 flow before the 
procedure and TIMI 3 flow after the procedure. There was no 
acute vessel closure. There was no perforation. There was no 
dissection. 

TTE ___
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses 
and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional left 
ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the 
basal to mid inferior wall. The remaining segments contract 
normally (LVEF = 55 %). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal 
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is a mild 
resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. There is no 
ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is 
mildly dilated The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending 
and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are 
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial 
mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic 
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial 
effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Regional left ventricular 
systolic dysfunction c/w CAD. Mild right ventricular cavity 
dilation. RV function difficult to assess given limited acoustic 
windows

Conclusions   
Pre-bypass

 The left atrium is normal in size. No mass/thrombus is seen in 
the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal 
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall 
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal 
(LVEF>55%). The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. 
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free 
wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly 
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. 
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a 
prominent fat pad. 

 Post-bypass

 The patient is in sinus rhythm and receiving a phenylephrine 
infusion.
 Biventricular function remains preserved.
 Valvular function is unchanged.
 The thoracic aorta is intact following decannulation. Medications On Admission: The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.

PRIOR STUDIES: CT of the head done on ___, reported as 
poorly defined hypodensity in the right periatrial region, with 
surrounding encephalomalacic changes, most likely represents old 
infarct.
MRI OF THE HEAD:
There are hypointense areas noted in the C2 and the C3 vertebral 
bodies on the sagittal T1-weighted sequence, which are 
inadequately evaluated on the present study.
Focal hypointense area in the right periatrial region, 
posteriorly (series 11, image 11) on the FLAIR sequence, with 
hyperintense signal on the T2-weighted sequence, likely 
represents encephalomalacic gliotic changes, related to old 
infarct. Similarly, in the left cerebellar hemisphere, there is 
a slight irregular linear focus, hypointense on the T2-weighted 
images (series 11, image 7), which can represent a small linear 
focus of scarring.
There are no areas of restricted diffusion, to suggest acute 
infarction.
3D TOF MR ANGIOGRAM OF THE HEAD: This study is limited due to 
motion artifacts. Within these limitations, the major 
intracranial arteries are patent. No focal flow-limiting 
stenosis or occlusion is noted within the limitations of the 
study. Slightly prominent basilar tip, and its termination, is 
likely related to infundibula at the origins of the posterior 
cerebral arteries.
Contour irregularity of the cavernous internal carotid arteries 
is noted, likely related to atherosclerotic disease. More 
accurate assessment for focal stenosis is limited due to 
artifacts.
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute infarction.
2. Major intracranial arteries are patent, within the 
limitations of motion artifacts, significantly limiting more 
accurate assessment for focal stenosis or tiny aneurysms.
3. Evidence of sequelae of chronic small vessel occlusive 
disease and old infarct in the right posterior periatrial 
region.
4. Hypointense areas in the C2 and C3 bodies as seen on the 
sagittal T1 W sequence are inadequately evaluated on the present 
study. These can be related to marrow disorder or focal 
neoplastic etiology. These can be better evaluated with MR ___ 
spine. Medications On Admission: ALL: NKDA

upon transfer from outside hospital with nasal fractures and 
epistaxis secondary to fall. The patient reports that he was at 
the ___ earlier this afternoon. While coughing, he tripped 
on the curb and suffered trauma to his face. He had no loss of 
consciousness. However, he had a persistent nosebleed and 
appeared to have some trauma to his face, thus was transferred 
to ___ for further care. There, a CT scan of 
the head, neck, and face were remarkable for a nasal bone and 
septal fracture. Given persistent epistaxis, bilateral 
RhinoRockets were placed. He had a small abrasion to the bridge 
of his nose which was not closed. Bleeding was well controlled. 
While in the OSH ED, he had an episode of nausea and coughed up 
some blood. At that time, he began to feel lightheaded and was 
noted to be hypotensive and bradycardic. Per report, he had a 
brief loss of consciousness, though quickly returned to his 
baseline. His family noted that his eyes rolled back into his 
head. The patient recalls the event and denies post-event 
confusion. He had no further episodes of syncope or hemodynamic 
changes.  Given the syncopal event and epistaxis, the patient

in the above injuries. At the end of the case a focal celiac 
ostia dissection was ID'd but not treated due to adequate flow 
into the liver and spleen through collaterals. No active 
extravasation was observed.  

She originally p/w several months of constipation and eventual 
LUQ pain for which she sought a colonoscopy and CT. The 
colonoscopy, while poorly prepped, was unrevealing, while the CT 
demonstrated a 6.0 x 7.3 cm segment IV liver mass that was 
difficult to separate from a thickened gallbladder fundus, a few 
subcentimeter hypodensities in the left lobe, as well as an 
increased number of porta hepatis lymph nodes, the largest being 
an 11mm caval lymph node. An ultrasound performed ___ measured 
the lesion at 8.8 x 6.3 and noted the adjacent GB wall 
thickening. A follow-up PET scan ___ noted increased 
radiouptake within the liver as well as a reported right iliac 
bone concerning for metastatic malignancy. Path biopsy on ___ 
was consistent with adenocarcinoma. 
 
In the SICU on ___, pt had pain and nausea; Ondansetron 
increased to q6 hours, IV dilaudid added for pain. She was 
transferred to ___ on ___ where her hospital course 
was complicated by persistent nausea and vomiting, RUQ pain, 
dyspnea, and poor PO intake. On ___ the patient was noted to 
be hypotensive with systolic pressures in the ___ and 
tachycardic to the 120s with an increasing oxygen requirement. 
Labs were significant for wbc 13.4 (from 12.9), lactate 2.5, Na 
132, ALT 260, AST 281, AP 414, Tb .3. ABG was ___. 
She was ordered for a CTA chest, abdomen, and pelvis, bolused 1L 
IVF, started on cipro/flagyl, and transferred to the MICU for 
further management. 
  
On arrival to the MICU, vitals were 98.4, 106/68, 121, 23, 94% 
(4L facemask. The patient reported dyspnea which had improved 
with supplemental oxygen. She denied any nausea, vomiting, 
abdominal pain, chest pain, dysuria, dizziness, other 
complaints.

___ ___ ___ VASCULAR EMBOLIZA 
PROCEDURE:  1. Right common femoral artery access. 
2. SMA arteriogram. 
3. Celiac arteriogram. 
4. Cone beam CT right hepatic arteriogram. 
5. Cone beam CT left hepatic arteriogram. 
6. Coil embolization of the right gastric artery. 
7. Amplatzer plug embolization of the left hepatic as well as 
left gastric 
arteries. 
8. Left gastric arteriogram. 
9. Celiac axis arteriogram. 
10. Aortogram. 
11. Right common femoral arteriogram and Angio-Seal closure of 
right common 
femoral artery 
PROCEDURE DETAILS: 
Following the discussion of the risks, benefits and alternatives 
to the 
procedure, written informed consent was obtained from the 
patient. The patient was then brought to the angiography suite 
and placed supine on the exam table.
 
A pre-procedure time-out was performed per ___ protocol. 
Using palpatory and fluoroscopic guidance, the right common 
femoral artery was punctured using a micropuncture set at the 
level of the mid femoral head. A 0.018 wire was passed easily 
into the vessel lumen. A small skin incision was made over the 
needle. Then the inner dilator and wire removed and a 0.035 
___ wire was advanced under fluoroscopy into the aorta. The 
micropuncture sheath was exchanged for a 5 ___ sheath which 
was attached to a continuous heparinized saline side arm flush. 
A C2 cobra catheter was advanced over ___ wire into the 
aorta. The wire was removed and the SMA was selectively 
cannulated and small contrast injection was made to confirm 
position. SMA arteriogram was performed. The catheter was 
removed and the celiac artery was selectively cannulated and a 
small contrast injection was made to confirm position. A celiac 
arteriogram was performed. This demonstrated a replaced left 
hepatic artery from left gastric artery. To further characterize 
the anatomy, a cone beam CT was performed at the right and left 
hepatic arteries. Attempts to advance the C2 catheter and a 
glidewire into the left gastric artery were unsuccessful. The C2 
catheter was exchanged for ___ 1 glide catheter which was 
eventually advanced into the left gastric artery. Using an STC 
micro catheter and a double angled glidewire, the left hepatic 
artery was selected and an arteriogram was performed. This 
demonstrated branching of the right gastric artery from left 
hepatic artery. The micro wire and catheter were advanced into 
the left hepatic artery and then into the right gastric artery. 
3 x 3 hilum coils were deployed at this location. The first coil 
was deployed within the right gastric artery. The second coiled 
was partially deployed in the right gastric artery and partially 
in the left hepatic artery. 
Further injections of contrast demonstrated diminished flow in 
the left 
hepatic artery and therefore nitroglycerin and heparin were 
injected to 
restore flow. Multiple attempts were made to snare the left 
hepatic artery  oil were unsuccessful. In part, due to unstable 
access at the celiac artery. At that time, the patient was 
uncomfortable on the table due to prolonged procedure time and 
anesthesia was consulted. The patient was intubated and the 
procedure was continued under general anesthesia. 
Subsequently, the existing 5 ___ sheath was exchanged for a 5 
___/ 65 cm sheath which was advanced into the left hepatic 
artery over ___ wire to provide more secure access. More 
attempts were made to snare the coil out were unsuccessful. 
Injection of contrast demonstrated an extraluminal blush 
however, the patient was hemodynamically stable. At that time, 
transplant surgery was consulted and suggested close monitoring 
given the patient's stability. We decided to embolize the left 
gastric artery (trunk that provides supply to the left hepatic 
artery) to prevent potential peritoneal bleeding. A 6mm 
Amplatzer plug was used to embolize the left hepatic artery an 8 
mm Amplatzer plug was used to embolize the left gastric artery 
(trunk). A celiac arteriogram was performed and demonstrated 
occluded left gastric, patent common hepatic and splenic 
arteries but stasis of contrast at the celiac axis suggesting 
focal dissection. There was antegrade flow to the splenic and 
the right hepatic arteries. Attempts to pass a wire into the 
celiac axis to place a stent were unsuccessful. The patient 
remained hemodynamically stable. 
Aortogram was performed to delineate the anatomy. At that time, 
we decided to conclude the procedure and monitor the patient 
clinically. 
A Common femoral arteriogram was performed prior to use of a 
closure device. All catheters and wires were removed and a 6 
___ Angio-Seal device was deployed. Manual pressure was held 
until hemostasis was achieved. The patient tolerated the 
procedure. 
CONE BEAM CT: A rotational angiogram and cone beam CT were 
performed of the right and left hepatic arteries.  Multiplanar 
reformatted images were 
reconstructed, including volume-rendered images, using an 
independent 
workstation and were specifically evaluated and processed by the Medications On Admission: The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.

CT Abdomen/Pelvis (___):  
1. Perihilar and left basilar airspace consolidation concerning 
for  
aspiration or pneumonia.  
2. Mild gaseous distention of the afferent limb of the Roux-en-Y 
with enteric contrast seen within the efferent limb extending to 
the left pelvis with more distal collapsed loops of distal ileum 
extending to the right ileostomy. Some enteric contrast does 
appear to extend to the ostomy site. It is unclear if the 
findings are secondary to the relatively short oral prep time or 
represent  
a very early small-bowel obstruction. Continued surveillance is 
recommended.  
3. Stable cystic lesion in the head of the pancreas.

A nonobstructed bowel gas pattern is evident  
with oral contrast seen projecting over the right lower lobe 
ostomy. There is a dense right renal shadow and contrast seen 
within both ureters from a recent CT scan. There is mild gaseous 
distention of the stomach. The lungs demonstrate perihilar 
airspace opacities concerning for pneumonia or aspiration. The 
aorta is calcified and ectatic. Again noted is a compression 
fracture of L2 with severe dextroscoliosis of the lumbar spine.

Baseline artifact. Sinus rhythm. The Q-T interval is 400 
milliseconds. Q waves in leads V1-V2 with ST-T wave 
abnormalities extending to lead V6. Consider prior anterior 
myocardial infarction. Since the previous tracing of ___ 
atrial premature beats are not seen. The Q-T interval is 
shorter. ST-T wave abnormalities are less prominent.  
 
CXR ___:
PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes. 
Tiny bilateral pleural effusions are new since ___. No 
signs of pneumonia or pulmonary vascular congestion. Heart is 
top normal in size though this is stable. Aorta is markedly 
tortuous, unchanged. Aortic arch calcifications are seen. There 
is no pneumothorax. No focal consolidation. Partially imaged 
upper abdomen is unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Tiny pleural effusions, new. Otherwise unremarkable.

ECHO ___:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial 
pressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity 
size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF 
>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are 
normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch 
levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly 
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or 
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully 
excluded due to suboptimal image quality. Trace aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
structurally normal. An eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of 
mild to moderate (___) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate 
[2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The end-diastolic 
pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting 
pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension. There is an anterior 
space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.

STUDIES
=========
TTE (___):  The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is 
markedly dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is at 
least 15 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The 
left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe 
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction (see map; only 
the basal anterior and lateral walls are relatively spared) 
(quantiative biplane LVEF = 13%). The estimated cardiac index is 
borderline low (2.0-2.5L/min/m2). No masses or thrombi are seen 
in the left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an 
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The 
right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with severe global 
free wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. 
The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) 
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No 
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate 
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature 
of the regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly 
underestimated (Coanda effect). The tricuspid valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid 
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic 
pressure is normal. [In the setting of at least moderate to 
severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery 
systolic pressure may be underestimated due to a very high right 
atrial pressure.] The pulmonic valve leaflets are thickened. The 
end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased 
suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Moderately dilated left ventricle with severe 
regional and global dysfunction. At least moderate mitral 
regurgitation. Dilated right ventricle with severe free wall 
hypokinesis. Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation. 
Pulmonary hypertension (extent not able to be quantified). 
Mildly dilated thoracic aorta. 

ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND (___):  IMPRESSION:  1.  
Cholelithiasis.  Mild gallbladder wall thickening and 
pericholecystic fluid is likely related to third spacing related 
to the patient's known heart failure. 2.  Nodular contour of the 
liver, unchanged from the prior CT.  Normal echogenicity.  3.  
Normal kidneys.

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST (___):  IMPRESSION:

1. Right Swan-Ganz catheter identified with the distal tip in 
the right lower lobe pulmonary artery. This needs to be 
retracted back to the level of the right ventricular outflow 
tract.
2. Severe cardiomegaly with four-chamber enlargement. AICD 
device identified.
3. Dense coronary artery calcifications.
4. Moderate centrilobular emphysema predominate within the upper 
lobes.
5. Slightly nodular contour of the liver, suggestive of 
cirrhosis.
6. Thickening of adrenal glands bilaterally, likely in keeping 
with adrenal
hyperplasia.
7. Small amount of fluid/ stranding identified surrounding the 
pancreatic head near the porta hepatis, not completely assess, 
likely related to trace ascites rather than pancreatitis in the 
absence of clinical history of abdominal pain.

LIVER BIOPSY (___):     SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT - Final
PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS:  Liver, needle core biopsy:

1. Bridging fibrosis with rare focus of early, incomplete nodule
formation and a focally prominent sinusoidal fibrotic component 
(Stage
___.

2. Severe sinusoidal dilation, focally pan-lobular/pan-zonal, 
with
prominent associated hepatocyte atrophy. Rare marked central 
venous
dilation present.

3. Mild portal and lobular mixed inflammation , consisting of
lymphocytes, scattered plasma cells, and neutrophils.

4. Mild bile duct damage with focal ductular proliferation and 
few
associated neutrophils.

5. Minimal steatosis identified.

6. Iron stain is negative for iron deposition; CMV and HSV
immunohistochemical stains are negative for viral inclusions, 
with
satisfactory positive control.

RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND (___):  IMPRESSION:  No 
evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the right lower extremity 
veins.

Hemodynamics (see above): Mild pulmonary hypertension (44/24/32
mm Hg) with markedly elevated PCW of 25 mm Hg with prominent V
wave superimposed on what appeared to be a partial PA waveform
suggesting significant mitral regurgitation. Despite several
attempts with small balloon volumes, no better PCW waveform 
could
be obtained. The true PASP and RVSP were difficult to ascertain
due to catheter fling. Using an assumed oxygen consumption and 
an
imputed arterial oxygen saturation, the CI was reduced at 1.7
L/min/m2.

Assessment & Recommendations
 1. Severely elevated PCW consistent with severe left 
ventricular
diastolic heart failure in setting of known severe left
ventricular systolic heart failure.
 2. Severe right ventricular diastolic heart failure.
 3. Mild pulmonary hypertension.
 4. No oxymetric evidence of significant right-to-left shunting
and likely no significant left-to-right shunting.
 5. Markedly depressed cardiac index.
 6. RFV sheath to be removed.
 7. Additional plans per Heart Failure Service. Reinforce
secondary preventative measures against CAD and LV systolic and
diastolic heart failure.

colon CA s/p XRT and total colectomy, AFib on coumadin, ___ 
with EF 30%< HLD, and obesity transferred from ___ 
___ for management of R arm swelling and discomfort.

Regarding relevant history, patient was recently admitted to 
___ ___ for vaginal bleeding and 
s/p fall in the setting of therapeutic INR of 3. Through work-up 
for vaginal bleeding conducted and including cystoscopy, 
colonoscopy, and CT A/P (patient is s/p hysterectomy) that were 
unrevealing, making atrophic vagina from prior XRT the most 
likely etiology.  In this setting, the patient's warfarin was 
held and she was recommended estrogen cream (but never took it). 
During this admission, patient had a PICC line placed ___ 
for IV access, lab draws, and medication administration that was 
removed on ___ prior to discharge.

Approximately 1 week after discharge, patient and daughter 
followed up with PCP ___.  She was told to restart 
coumadin approximately 1 week after this appointment, so she has 
been back ___ coumadin for ___ weeks.  In this setting, 
patient's vaginal bleeding has recurred. She was recommended an 
estrogen ring, but declined.

Per the patient's daughter, the patient developed some R finger 
swelling starting a week or so ago that was initially attributed 
to her arthritis.  She then developed increasing hand swelling, 
for which she presented to PCP's urgent care office and was 
prescribed Keflex ___ for presumed cellulitis.  Given that the 
pain persisted/worsened, the patient subsequently presented to 
___.  ED physician there was concerned for blood clot 
given lack of evidence for infection (no fevers or 
leukocytosis), and because of their hospital's inability to 
obtain an U/S over the weekend, patient was transferred to ___ 
for further management.

notable for K 3.1, Cr 1.5, INR 2.6.  R UENI notable for 
"non-occlusive thrombus in the right mid cephalic vein which 
also has the PICC line/venous line. Clot does not extend to the 
axillary vein." Per OSH ED reports, line in RUE was actually an 
IV. This was removed and replaced with LEJ peripheral IV. Given 
concern for clot in the setting of therapeutic INR, patient is 
being admitted to Medicine for further management. VS prior to 
transfer 98.5 84 sBP 130 16 96% RA. 
 
Upon arrival to the floor, VS Afebrile 106/65 88 16 100%RA.

history of progressive weakness, muscle cramping, 
fasciculations, dysphagia, weak cough, and unintentional weight 
loss. 
 
According to notes, the shortness of breath started almost one 
year ago.  Initially, it was most notable with ambulation and 
exertion.  In the past ___ months, however, Mr. ___ has had 
trouble breathing during more sedentary activities.  He has 
marked difficulty lying flat.  For the syndrome, he has 
presented for evaluation on several occasions.  He was initially 
found to have SVT.  He underwent ablation in ___ with no 
recurrence based on holter monitoring.  A stress test (___) 
was unrevealing.  Echo (___) showed left atrial dilation and 
LVH with a normal LVEF.  
 
He has also visited with the pulmonology team.  Investigatiry 
studies revealed a possible restrictive ventilatory deficit.  
There was no asymmetry of the diaphragm noted on CXR from 
___. The pulmonary team raised concern about ALS when the 
patient was noted to have fasciculations on examination.  
(Accordingly, the patient was scheduled to see Dr. ___ 
___.  The patient and family have noted the fasciculations 
in all limbs, and indicate they have become progressively 
pronounced.  The fasciculations or "body tremors"  occur in 
combination with muscle craming and weakness.
  
According to all accounts, Mr. ___ started to notice the 
gradual onset of weakness in the ___.  He recalls 
distal lower exrtemity weakness first, saying he tripped over 
his feet sometimes.  Over time he developed proximal weakness; 
he had trouble climbing out of cars and rising from seats.  More 
recently, he developed difficulty with fine finger movements and 
now has keeping his arms above his head to complete tasks.  
There was no clear trigger.  There are no exacerbating factors, 
and the symptoms do not seem to worsen throughout the day or get 
better after rest.  There are no alleviating factors.  
  
The weakness has been associated with many other symptoms 
including weight loss; he has unintentionally lost about 30 
pounds in the last 6 months.  He attributes the weight loss to 
anorexia.  He thinks that most of the weight loss manifests as 
loss of muscle mass.  For the weight loss and systemic symptoms, 
Mr. ___ has undergone CXR and colonoscopy which were negative. 
 He has also had HIV testing, which was negative.
  
He presents to the ED today due to increasing respiratory 
distress.  Due to initial tachycardia, tachypnea, and use of 
accessory muscles, he was placed on bipap.  Since that time, his 
vital signs have normalized.  Neurology is consulted for 
evaluation of an underlying neurological cause of respiratory
weakness.

FINDINGS: 
Left median motor nerve conduction studies shows normal distal 
latency, mild-to-moderately reduced response amplitudes, and 
mildly decreased conduction velocity. F-response minimum latency 
was mildly prolonged. 
  
Left ulnar motor nerve conduction studies were normal, including 
F waves. 
  
Left deep peroneal motor nerve conduction studies showed normal 
distal latency, normal response amplitudes, mildly reduced 
conduction velocity in the leg, and mildly reduced conduction 
velocity across the knee. F-response minimum latency was normal.

because of epigastric abd pain and LUQ and pain for one day 
prior to the admission to the OSH.  In the meantime, she was 
found to have acute pancreatitis that was associated with 
hyperbilirubinemia and transaminitis as well as a dilation of 
the biliary system on MRCP. She did not have fever or chill. Her 
HCt was 42% and her BUN was 14 on ___. In the OSH, ERCP was 
attempted However, due to the development of A-fib with RVR, the 
ERCP was aborted.  When the pt had A-fib with RVR, she received 
diltiazem drip and her TTE was normal.  Her rate has been under 
control thus far.  Of note, her CT of the abdomen showed 
dilatation of the biliary system.  Her US showed fatty liver and 
dilatation of intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ducts and 
the main pancreatic duct, which were unchanged from previous 
studies on ___ and ___.  Her MRCP showed moderate 
intrahepatic biliary dilatation with marked dilatation of the 
CBD and pancreatic duct and heterogeneity of the pancreatic 
signal.  On transfer, her WBC was 6.7, Hct was 37%, Alk was 96, 
T.B 0.5, Cr was 0.47, Alb was 3.1, AST was 27, and ALT was 128.

After she was admitted to the OSH, she remained on NPO followed 
by clear liquid diet on yesterday.  Her abd pain slowly resolved 
36 hours ago prior to the transfer.  However, she developed 
intermittent left side chest pressure sensation, which was not 
associated with N/V, diaphoresis, hypoxia, palpitation, SOB, or 
cough.

IMAGING AND STUDIES
CXR ___:
FINDINGS: There are ill-defined somewhat elongated opacities 
extending into the lateral aspects of the right upper lung. More 
linear fine interstitial lines are noted at the lung bases, 
particularly on the left. Lung volumes are diminished 
inferiorly. There is mild aortic tortuosity. The cardiac 
silhouette is grossly within normal limits for size, though 
evaluation limited by low lung volumes. No definite effusion or 
pneumothorax is seen. There is a slight dextroconcave curvature 
of the mid and lower thoracic spine. 
  
IMPRESSION: Ill-defined densities laterally in the right upper 
lung of 
indeterminate chronicity. Diagnostic considerations include 
mucoid impaction in the setting of bronchiectasis versus 
underlying pulmonary nodules.  Conceivably early developing 
focal infiltrate may also account for this appearance. 

Hand Xray ___
COMPARISON: Left wrist radiographs ___ and left hand 
radiographs 
___. 
  
INDICATION: Evaluate for possible RA or other erosive arthritis. 

  
FINDINGS: 
  
LEFT HAND: Limited evaluation due to technique. Unremarkable 
soft tissues.  
A BB marker is placed over the base of the long finger 
metacarpal. Osteopenia 
which limits evaluation for fractures. No definite fractures 
identified.  
There is mild radiocarpal joint space narrowing. There is 
widening of the 
scapholunate interval. There is degenerative change at the 
capitolunate 
articulation with joint space narrowing and mild sclerosis. No 
definite 
erosions identified. Unchanged ulnar styloid which appears 
absent. Pulse 
oximeter overlies the distal phalanx of the long finger and 
obscures the bony 
detail. 
  
RIGHT HAND: BB marker is placed over the capitate. Unremarkable 
soft 
tissues. Osteopenia which limits the evaluation for fractures. 
No definite 
fracture. No dislocations. Mild degenerative changes of the DIP 
joints with 
joint space narrowing. Mild scapholunate widening. No definite 
erosions. IV 
tubing overlies the wrist. 
  
IMPRESSION: No definite erosive changes bilaterally. 

Knee XRAY ___

FINDINGS: BB markers are placed over the patellas bilaterally. 
Unremarkable 
soft tissues bilaterally. No joint effusions bilaterally. No 
definite 
fractures. No dislocations. No erosive changes identified. Mild 
right knee 
tibial spine spurring and medial compartment osteophytosis. 
Bilateral mild 
patellar enthesopathy. 
  
IMPRESSION: No erosive changes bilaterally. 

Chest XRAY PA/Lateral ___
Final Report 
PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___ AT 2244 HOURS. 
  
HISTORY: Syncope. 
  
COMPARISON: None. 
  
FINDINGS: There are ill-defined somewhat elongated opacities 
extending into 
the lateral aspects of the right upper lung. More linear fine 
interstitial 
lines are noted at the lung bases, particularly on the left. 
Lung volumes are 
diminished inferiorly. There is mild aortic tortuosity. The 
cardiac 
silhouette is grossly within normal limits for size, though 
evaluation limited 
by low lung volumes. No definite effusion or pneumothorax is 
seen. There is 
a slight dextroconcave curvature of the mid and lower thoracic 
spine. 
  
IMPRESSION: Ill-defined densities laterally in the right upper 
lung of 
indeterminate chronicity. Diagnostic considerations include 
mucoid impaction 
in the setting of bronchiectasis versus underlying pulmonary 
nodules.  
Conceivably early developing focal infiltrate may also account 
for this 
appearance. 

Chest XRAY PA/Lateral ___
Final Report 
CHEST RADIOGRAPH 
  
INDICATION: Dual pacemaker, check lead position. 
  
COMPARISON: ___. 
  
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is 
unchanged evidence 
of opacities in the right upper lobe. A new left pectoral 
pacemaker has been 
introduced, one lead is positioned in the right ventricle and 
one lead is 
positioned in the right atrium. The course of the leads is 
unremarkable.  
There is no evidence of fracture and no evidence of

IMAGING & STUDIES
===========================
___ CTA HEAD/NECK WWO CONTRAST
IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive confluent white matter disease, likely secondary to 
combination
of posttreatment changes and chronic microvascular ischemic 
disease, which
limits evaluation for acute infarct.
2. Geographic hypodensity in the right subcortical temporal lobe 
is consistent
with previously seen vasogenic edema.  Recommend correlation 
with prior MRI
from ___.
3. No evidence for acute intracranial hemorrhage.
4. Patent right common carotid/internal carotid artery stent.
5. Stable short segment focal high-grade stenosis of the 
mid-basilar artery.
6. Stable right upper lobe lung nodules since ___.

CXR PA/Lat ___
IMPRESSION: 
No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.

EEG ___
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal routine EEG in the awake and 
drowsy states due
to the presence of frequent bursts of generalized delta 
frequency slowing as
well as occasional bursts of right frontotemporal focal delta 
frequency
slowing during wakefulness. These findings are consistent with 
deep midline
brain dysfunction and an additional independent focus of 
subcortical
dysfunction in the right frontotemporal region. The background 
is mildly
disorganized, suggesting a mild diffuse encephalopathy. There 
are no
epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures in this 
recording.

CT ABD/PELV WO CONTRAST ___
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute findings in the abdomen or pelvis.
2. Small volume free pelvic fluid of unclear etiology, unchanged 
since the
prior exam.
3. Fibroid uterus.

TTE ___
Conclusions
The left atrial volume index is normal. No atrial septal defect 
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial 
pressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity 
size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are 
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (?#) appear structurally 
normal with good leaflet excursion. No aortic stenosis is 
pesent. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate (___) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity 
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] 
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. 
There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Mild mitral leaflet and subvalvular apparatus 
thickening with mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. Normal 
biventricular cavity sizes with preserved regional and global 
biventricular systolic function. Increased PCWP. No definite 
structural cardiac source of embolism identified.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: 
Based on ___ AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the 
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical 
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on 
clinical and echocardiographic data. 

MR HEAD WO CONTRAST ___
IMPRESSION:
1. Small acute infarctions in the pons and posterior superior 
right cerebellar
hemisphere.  No evidence of hemorrhage, edema or mass effect.
2. Extensive stable matter signal abnormality, likely 
combination of
posttreatment changes and chronic microvascular ischemic 
disease.
3. Stable subcortical white matter disease in the right temporal 
lobe. 
Previously seen contrast enhancing lesion in the right temporal 
lobe is
similar in size to prior examination measuring approximately 1.1 
cm in
greatest dimension, however incompletely characterized given 
lack of contrast
administration on the current examination.

resection and radiation with R temporal lesion thought to be due 
to radiation necrosis (followed by Dr. ___, episodes of R 
facial pain, chronic daily HA, and episodes of panic, confusion, 
and R hemibody numbness (?szs per Dr. ___, and PNES, 
who came into ED with nausea/vomiting and right sided numbness. 
Largely negative workup except for orthostatic hypotension. Then 
found to have small cerebellar and pontine infarcts on MRI. 

# Cerebellar/pontine stroke: Per MRI, very small infarcts in 
this region. Likely due to decreased perfusion in the setting of 
gastroenteritis and very narrow basilar artery.  She did not 
appear to have consequential gross neurologic deficits during 
this admission.  Her 20min EEG was not concerning.  Her 
transient facial droop and numbness does not correspond to the 
location of the lesion and reportedly occurred in the past, 
though to be possibly related to her PNES per Dr. ___.  She 
does have hyperlipidemia with LDL 163, so clopidogrel and 
atorvastatin 80mg daily were started for secondary prevention.  
Start dual antiplatelet therapy, add clopidogrel to current 
aspirin therapy.  She will follow up with her current 
neurologist Dr. ___ have home ___.  

# Viral gastroenteritis/orthostatic hypotension: Pt reported 
nausea/vomiting prior to admission and had positive orthostatic 
vital signs in the ED.  She also has had poor PO intake 
chronically.  Her GI symptoms improved during the admission.  
She was started on nutrition supplements and given IV fluids, 
with good response.  She worked with ___ on day of discharge 
without symptoms.  Her antihypertensives were held at discharge. 
 SBPs were 150s at discharge.  She was encouraged to take PO and 
nutritional supplements.  

# Hypothyroidism: TSH was 34 at admission.  Given her altered 
mental status and orthostatic hypotension, her home 
levothyroxine was increased from 50mcg to 75mcg daily.    

CHRONIC ISSUES
==================================
# Hypertension: Her home antihypertensives were held in the 
setting of orthostatic hypotension.

# PNES: Topamax and lorazepam were initially held given her 
altered mental status.  Topamax was restarted but lorazepam was 
held to prevent further episodes of confusion after discussion 
with family and outpatient neurologist.

# Depression: She was continued on sertraline.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
==================================
-Patient should work with home ___ given deconditioning from 
her acute illness and acute stroke
-Please recheck TSH in ___ weeks and adjust levothyroxine dose 
as necessary.
-Home lorazepam was held given her altered mental status, and 
after discussion with outpatient neurologist Dr. ___ 
-___ orthostatic hypotension, antihypertensives were held at 
discharge. Her supine SBPs were 150s at discharge.  Please check 
orthostatic vital signs at home and PCP followup and consider

Colonoscopy History Of Present Illness: Ms. ___ is a ___ yo woman with h/o Behcet syndrome, s/p 
Roux en Y ___ years ago, who presents with several months of 
abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, and 40 lb weight loss, now 
referred for inpatient GI workup.

Patient initially had Roux en Y ___ years ago, with postop course 
c/b acute obstruction with frank BRBPR requiring urgent surgery 
for a "kink." She required PEG with TFs for some time and 
subsequently did will with about 120 lb weight loss. About ___ 
year ago she progressively developed her current symptoms. She 
has noted difficulty tolerating POs with intermittent vomiting 
of undigested food 30 min after eating. This is somewhat better 
with liquids than solids but it is not obvious to her which 
foods are going to trigger the vomiting. This has worsened to 
the point that she is only able to tolerate 2x 6 oz cups of

RADIOLOGY:
----------

CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS ___
1. Intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilation.  
Patient status post cholecystectomy.  Please correlate 
clinically as a distal obstruction is difficult to exclude.  
MRCP is recommended for further evaluation. 
2. Pancreas divisum. 
3. No bowel obstruction in this patient status post gastric 
bypass surgery. 
4. Retained catheter in the right body wall extending into the 
central spinal canal for which clinical correlation is advised. 

CTA HEAD/NECK ___
1. Normal CTA of the head. 
2. Patent vasculature in the neck with no evidence of internal 
carotid artery stenosis by NASCET criteria. 
3. No acute intracranial abnormality. 

UPPER GI SERIES ___
No evidence of esophageal dysmotility or anastomotic stricture 
to explain 
symptoms. 

RUQ ULTRASOUND ___ile duct stones.  Ectatic common bile duct measuring 
9 mm may 
reflect s/p cholecystectomy.
ADDENDUM  Upon further review of the the images the duodenum is 
the 
eccentrically thickened in the region of the ampulla which 
raises concern for a periampullary mass best seen on series 1a, 
image 41 and series 1b, image 263/351.  Further evaluation with 
ERCP or PTC if ERCP is unsuccessful is recommended.

ENDOSCOPY:
----------

EGD ___
Anatomy consistent with known Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. The 
stomach pouch was small. The GJ anastomosis was carefully 
examined and appears intact, with no ulcers. (biopsy: normal)
Normal mucosa in the duodenum (biopsy: normal)
Otherwise normal EGD to jejunum

EUS ___
Linear EUS was performed with the Olympus enchoendoscope at 
7.5mHz. A focused/limited EUS evaluation was possible given the 
gastric bypass anatomy, which does not allow EUS visualization 
from the duodenal bulb (for critical distal biliary and 
ampullary view). The PD was measured at 2.2mm in the body, and 
2.5mm in the head, which is normal diameter. The intrahepatic 
biliary system was slightly dilated, and the extrahepatic 
CHD/CBD was only mildly dilated (maximum diameter 7.8mm), within 
the normal limits for post CCY state. The CBD cannot be traced 
to the ampulla because of the gastric bypass anatomy. No filling 
defects or mass is seen.
Limited eval with EUS scope notable for gastric bypass anatomy 

Recommendations: Will need careful review of prior CT scans from 
___ and ___. Biliary dilation is 
likely benign/post CCY. This can often be more prominent after 
gastric bypass ___ et al J. Gastro Surg ___. It is 
important to demonstrate stability over time. If prior scans 
show no biliary dilation, then can consider single balloon to 
evaluate ampulla and further surveillance imaging to rule out 
mass. 

COLONOSCOPY ___
Polyp at 20cm in the distal sigmoid colon (polypectomy)
No bleeding seen.

(panic) who was sent to ___ at recommendation of ___, his
therapist of 4 months at ___ for evaluation of 3 weeks of
worsening depression with anhedonia, social isolation &
withdrawal, escalating feelings of guilt, poor sleep secondary 
to
ruminations of guilt.  Patient is also having trouble
concentrating and going to his other classes because of his
depression and anxiety.  He has been eating fine and taking care
of himself w/r/t hygiene.  Mr. ___ reported that what seems
have caused his recent bout of anxiety is the culmination of

at
his program.  For reasons that are not completely clear, patient
was removed from a studio class with a particular instructor. 
Patient referred me to speak with ___ to explain the 
specifics,
but ___ was not available and patient felt too
overwhelmed to give me the story in detail--in fact had a panic
attack during our talk.  For the past weeks, since being removed
from the class, Mr. ___ has written letters, called (did 
not
leave messages) and emailed this instructor w/o getting any
response.  The lack of response has caused an escalating pattern
of guilt that Mr. ___ has been dealing with by cutting
himself with a knife (cut left wrist, no stitches).  Last night,
in the context of this guilt, not sleeping and having more
anxiety, Mr. ___ began feeling suicidal and developed a 
plan

the only way he could deal with his overwhelming feelings would
be suicide.  Mr. ___ told his counselor about these 
thoughts

h/o ___ psychotic symptoms, although his level of guilt has
reached a near psychotic proportion.  Mr. ___ denied ever
being asked by the instructor never to contact him, but he feels
the instructor not answering his calls or responding to emails
means that the instructor does not like him.  He denied any
thoughts of trying to harm the instructor.

different in school.

Mr. ___ reported that he had thoughts of fighting with a
fellow student a few months ago, which is why he started in
counseling (he said he did not want to get into details re. that
situation). He said that ultimately he was able to come to terms

behavior.

Bipolar Disorder / Psychosis, now presenting with acute 
agitation. 

Patient with potentially prior late diagnosis of Bipolar 
Disorder / Psychosis? was previously living in ___ for the 
past year, and returned to ___ because of mental status 
changes. 6 weeks prior, Husband reports that she had become 
depressed secondary to potentially stress. She was also drinking 
alcohol, and she was being self-medicated with lorazepam and 
Haldol (which she had been previously described before). She now 
is a "basket case", and feels more paranoid and has potentially 
lost perception with reality. Patient thinks that everyone is 
against her. Her husband notes that she can be somewhat 
aggressive sometimes. She does endorse "emptiness" in her head, 
and her husband believes that she may have suffered several 
strokes in the past as well. She does not have any headaches, 
numbness/tingling, focal neurological deficits, or loss of 
function. Patient was first evaluated and found to have 
potentially an exacerbation of bipolar disorder vs. alcohol use 
vs. organic neurologic process. Patient was then evaluated to 
potentially need geriatric psych management. 

Past Psychiatry History: Reviewed in OMR. Patient was initially 
diagnosed with a bipolar disorder and had a psychotic break a 
few  years ago. At that time, she was treated with Haldol and 
Ativan, and had somewhat improvement. Patient was then 
potentially tailored off medications, and then went into a 
"manic phase" that lasted ? "about a year". Patient was very 
energetic previously, and then mood stable. She was also 
drinking alcohol at that time. Last year, she and her husband 
then moved to ___ for financial reasons and returned to the 
___ because of mental status changes. 

In the ED, initial vitals: 97.9 76 125/81 16 98% RA

___ Imaging CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST : There is no 
intra-axial or extra-axial hemorrhage, edema, shift of normally 
midline structures, or evidence of acute major vascular 
territorial infarction. Ventricles and sulci are normal in 
overall size and configuration. There is a mucus retention cyst 
in the left maxillary sinus with thickening of the lateral wall 
of the left maxilla suggesting chronic inflammation.  The 
remaining imaged paranasal sinuses are clear. Mastoid air cells 
and middle ear cavities are well aerated. The bony calvarium is 
intact. 
 
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process. 

___ Imaging MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAS :   
Study is mildly degraded by motion.  There is no evidence of 
hemorrhage, 
edema, masses, mass effect, midline shift or infarction.  There 
is prominence of the ventricles and sulci suggestive 
involutional changes.  Few subcortical T2 and FLAIR 
hyperintensities are noted. There is no abnormal enhancement 
after contrast administration.  The major vascular flow voids 
are preserved. There is partial opacification of the mastoid air 
cells.  Mucosal thickening with an air-fluid levels noted in the 
left maxillary sinus.  Mild mucosal thickening of the ethmoid 
sinuses seen.  There is a 0.9 cm Tornwaldt cyst versus mucous 
retention cyst in the posterior nasopharynx.  The orbits and 
visualized soft tissues are otherwise normal.  Nonspecific 
bilateral mastoid fluid is present.  
Degenerative changes are noted in the upper cervical spine. 
 
IMPRESSION:   
1.  Study is mildly degraded by motion. 
2. No acute intracranial abnormality.

CABG x3 in ___, aortic stenosis s/p aortic valve replacement, 
HTN, CKD III, pulmonary sarcoidosis, and GERD who is presenting 
with hematochezia.

The patient was in his usual health prior to presenting on ___ 
for a routine screening colonoscopy. He had a 1 cm polyp removed 
via endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR). Once he returned at home 
after the procedure, he had 4 episodes of bright red blood 
covering his stool and in the toilet bowl, without rectal pain 
or dark stools. He had not had bloody stools beforehand. He 
called
the GI office who recommended that he go to the nearest ED. He 
was then transferred from an ED in ___ to ___. He had no 
associated symptoms of lightheadedness, vision changes, syncope, 
head strike, chest pain, palpitations, or abdominal pain. 

In the ED, the patient's vitals were stable. His exam was 
notable for bright red blood in the rectal vault, but was 
otherwise normal. Labs including CBC had a Hgb 15.7, Chem-10 
with Cr 1.5 (baseline). GI was consulted and performed a 
flexible sigmoidoscopy on ___ which showed bleeding from the 
polyp removal site. He received epinephrine injection and 3 
endoclips with adequate hemostasis. Postprocedurally, he 
developed crampy abdominal pain with distension. An abdominal 
X-Ray showed nonobstructive bowel gas pattern with an overall 
paucity of bowel gas. Due to his unrelenting pain, he had a 
repeat flex sig which didn't identify perforation or repeat 
bleeding. Air was suctioned
out, after which his symptoms improved. On repeat CBC, H/H with 
1.1 HgB drop from 15.8 to 14.7 and new leukocytosis to 12. 

On arrival to the floor, the patient is having dinner and feels 
well. He is pain free and has not had any bloody BM over the 
last 24h. He reminds me that he's a Jehovah's witness and would 
not receive blood products should he need them. Past Medical History: CAD, s/p CABG x3 in ___

Findings  
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: No ASD by 2D or color Doppler. 

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and 
global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Suboptimal technical 
quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully 
excluded. Estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). 
Doppler parameters are indeterminate for LV diastolic function. 
No resting LVOT gradient. 

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size. Borderline normal RV 
systolic function. 

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal 
calcifications in aortic root. 

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. 
No AR. 

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP. 
Calcified tips of papillary muscles. 

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial 
TR. Normal PA systolic pressure. 

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet. 
No PS. Physiologic PR. 

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion. 

GENERAL COMMENTS: Frequent atrial premature beats.  
Conclusions  
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is 
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity 
size and global systolic function (LVEF>60%). Due to suboptimal 
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be 
fully excluded. The estimated cardiac index is normal 
(>=2.5L/min/m2). Doppler parameters are indeterminate for left 
ventricular diastolic function. Right ventricular chamber size 
is normal with borderline low systolic free wall function. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic 
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral 
valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure 
is normal. There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
preserved global ventricular systolic function. Normal right 
ventricular cavity size with borderline low free wall systolic 
function.   

CXR FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous examination, there is 
now evidence of normal lung volumes without evidence of fibrotic 
changes.  Status post sternotomy with unchanged sternotomy 
wires.  Calcified granuloma at the right upper lobe base.  
Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without overt 
pulmonary edema.  Moderate tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  No 
evidence of pneumonia.  No signs suggesting pulmonary fibrosis.

water intake. Major Surgical Or Invasive Procedure: Placement of venting gastric tube History Of Present Illness: Mr. ___ is a ___ M h/o colon CA s/p colectomy with end 
colostomy, lung CA s/p ___ transferred to ___ after a 
syncopal episode with headstrike. Pt had 2 weeks of n/v w/ 
non-bloody, slightly green emesis. Stools appeared more liquidy 
in ostomy bad but were non-bloody. Pt's PO intake became 
progressively worse and son reports him looking progressively 
fatigued and taking in very little food or water by the end of 
the 2 weeks. This was accompanied by ___ lb weight loss. Pt 
also developed neck pain recently. Pt also developed cough 
productive for clear phlegm (no hemoptysis) and has had 
shortness of breath. No fevers, chills, night sweats, headaches, 
numbness/tingling, sensory disturbances, focal motor issues, 
seizures, chest pain, back pain, abdominal pain, calf pain, or 
swelling. 

During this time, he developed several days of light-headedness 
and was taking a shower when the light-headedness worsened and 
he passed out with headstrike. No history of prior 
thrombotic/clotting episodes.  At OSH, he was hypothermic with 
elevated lactate (3.3) and leukocytosis (WBC 18.3). CT head was 
negative. CT chest revealed potential pneumonia vs scarring. EKG 
was notable for sinus tachycardia with diffuse ST depressions 
(not pt's baseline). He was fluid resuscitated and given 
cefepime at the outside hospital. He was transferred to ___ 
where his lactate was 1.6. His CT studies were concerning for 
SBO and revealed a C7 compression fracture w/ lytic lesions, and 
paraspinal lesion that could be metastasis or abscess. He was 
given vanc and zosyn for suspected infection and sepsis as his 
WBC was 20. 

Pt was admitted to ___ for his SBO and managed conservatively as 
pt was poor surgical candidate given malignancy. NGT placed and 
pt responded well with decreased n/v. Now s/p NGT removal, pt is 
being transferred to the floor for further coordination of care 
and management of C7 compression fracture and paraspinal lesion.
 
On the floor, pt is tired but mood is not depressed.  Reports 
nausea and vomiting resolved, no abdominal pain.  Has not passed 
flatus.  No fevers or chills.  No difficulty breathing.  No neck 
pain.  No numbness or tingling. Past Medical History: Diabetes mellitus

Name: Ayaan Naik Unit No: 96478882 Admission Date: 2022-10-13 Date Of Birth: 1983-11-13 Sex: M Service: NEUROLOGY Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions Attending: Dr. Iyer Chief Complaint: headache and arm contraction Major Surgical Or Invasive Procedure: none History Of Present Illness: The pt is a ___ previously healthy man with a 2 month
history of intermittent headaches and R thumb "cramps" who
presents tonight after an episode of R arm dystonic posturing in
the setting of a headache. He reports that he has had
intermittent "brain freeze" headaches over the last few months.
They are dull, holocephalic, not too severe, and typically
improve with advil or on their own. Over the same period of time
he has had ___ episodes of R thumb "cramps," usually in
association with a headache. He says that his R thumb will
suddenly start to be pulled over toward his pinky finger in a
painful, forcible way. This will last ___ minutes and then
resolve, and his thumb and lateral hand will feel sore afterward
like a muscle cramp. He reports intermittent R sided neck pain 
as
well but is unsure if this correlates with these other symptoms.
Looking back he says these did usually seem to occur along with 
a
headache but he didn't think too much of it until yesterday when
he had a more dramatic episode. He was at work yesterday evening
and developed a mild, typical headache. It had lasted about 20
minutes and he was thinking of taking something for it when his 
R
thumb again began to cramp up. Over the next ___ seconds this 
then
spread to involve his whole R arm. The rest of his fingers first
became painfully contorted as well, then his wrist flexed,
followed by forced flexion of his arm all the way up to his
shoulder, and then painful contraction of his shoulder and neck
muscles as well. He said he felt like he could not control his
arm at all. He tried with his left hand to open up his hand and
bend his arm back down but was unable. The whole episode lasted
about 30 seconds, and he says by the time it had spread up to 
his
neck his hand was beginning to relax. Shortly thereafter his
whole arm relaxed and returned to normal. There was no weakness
in his arm afterward and it felt sore but he was able to use it
normally. There was no shaking of the arm during this, and no
involvement of any of his other extremities. He remained alert
and lucid and able to think and speak clearly throughout this. 
He
called his PCP who recommended that he come into the ED.

In addition, he reports occasional severe headaches which are
different from the ones described above and wake him from sleep
in the early morning. He works as a ___ from
4pm to 2:30am and usually goes to sleep around 3:30am. Over the
last several months he has been woken from sleep by very severe
headaches a few hours after going to bed around 5 or 6am. The
headaches are constant, sharp pain, holocephalic but mostly
bitemporal, without any throbbing or photophobia. There are no
other associated symptoms. He often cannot go back to sleep so
gets up and takes some advil. The headaches can last up to ___
hours. There is no positional component to them, and he can 
often
go back to sleep after they resolve. These tend to happen about
once a month, and they seem to cluster together somewhat. He 
will
often get two in one week and then won't have any more for ___
months. He most recently had two of these last week. He denies
any history of exertional headaches or headaches during
intercourse. He works out quite strenuously on the elliptical
machine and never gets headaches during this.

He presented to ___ after this episode earlier. Basic
labwork was normal (other than K 3.3). A CT head was initially
thought be normal but was subsequently reviewed by 
neuroradiology
and there was some concern for hyperdensity of the venous 
sinuses
as well as the intracranial arteries. He was therefore
transferred to ___ for neurologic evaluation and further
management.

Currently he is feeling well with a mild frontal HA and some
residual soreness in his R arm but no other complaints.

On further history he and his wife reports a few other odd
symptoms over the last several months to year. He reports
episodes of memory lapses for which he went to see his PCP last
fall. He says at times he will be walking or doing something and
suddenly will realize time has gone by and he isn't sure what
happened. His wife also reports that he has a tendency to fall
asleep without warning at any time of the day. They will be
sitting and talking and she will look away for a minute and then
look back and he will be fast asleep. He is often difficult to
arouse and will sometimes sleep for an hour after this. He will
then wake up and ask what happened, not realizing he had fallen
asleep.

On neuro ROS, the pt denies changes in vision, lightheadedness,
difficulty speaking, focal weakness, numbness, parasthesiae. No
bowel or bladder incontinence or retention. Denies difficulty
with gait.

On general review of systems, the pt denies recent fever or
chills. Denies cough, shortness of breath.  Denies chest pain or

from a previously existing umbilical hernia.
Patient was evaluated and urgently taken to the OR with Dr 
___ for  umbilical hernia repair with a diagnosis of 
Cirrhosis and leaking in a necrotic
umbilical hernia.

At the time of surgery there was necrotic umbilical skin at the 
abdominal wall.  The
hernia sac was entered and transected. There were several 
varices present which were  ligated. The umbilicus and hernia 
sac were completely resected, the defect was about 4 cm which 
was primarily closed. Approximately one liter of ascites was 
drained at the time of surgery. He did receive albumin for this 
ascites drainage. 
The patient tolerated the procedure without complication, was 
extubated and transferred to PACU in stable condition.

Blood cultures were obtained on admission to ED, and a culture 
was sent from the ascites fluid drained at the time of the 
surgery. There was no growth in either specimen.
He was given IV Ceftriaxone while hospitalized, was transitioned 
to PO Cipro for home with a one week course of BID, and then 
daily for prophylaxis

Post operatively, the patient did well. The dressing remained 
clean dry and intact with no ascites drainage noted.
The Foley was removed on the evening of POD 1, and he voided 
without difficulty.

His diet was advanced, and was ultimately placed on a low sodium 
diet, seen by nutrition and recommended for supplements in 
addition to his usual diet.

His abdomen remained fairly flat with no evidence of large 
volume ascites re accumulation.
Incision was open to air, and remained clean dry and intact.
He was evaluated by ___ who found him to have no specific ___ 
needs for home.
He will have close follow up in the outpatient clinic Medications On Admission: The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.

CARDIOLOGY:
ECHO ___:
Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. The right atrium is 
moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or 
color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild regional left 
ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal to mid inferior 
dyskinesis and basal to mid inferolateral hypokinesis/akinesis. 
Doppler parameters are most consistent with Grade II (moderate) 
left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. The remaining left 
ventricular segments contract normally. Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve 
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is no aortic valve 
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is partial posterior mitral 
leaflet flail. An eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of Moderate 
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature 
of the regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly 
underestimated (Coanda effect). The tricuspid valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic 
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion. There is 
an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat 
pad.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric LVH with regional left ventricular 
systolic dysfunction consistent with CAD. Probable partial flail 
of the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve with consequent at 
least moderate mitral regurgitation that is directed anteriorly. 
Normal right ventricular function.

COMMENTS:     
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated severe, diffuse left coronary artery disease. The 
___ had
an 80% distal stenosis. The LAD had an 80% proximal stenosis 
followed by
a 100% stenosis in its mid portion. The LCx had a 100% stenosis 
after
OM1, and OM1 had a 60% stenosis at its origin. The RCA was not
visualized as it is known to be chronically occluded.
2. Arterial conduit angiography demonstrated no angiographically
apparent, flow-limiting stenosis of the LIMA graft to LAD. There 
were
patent collaterals to RCA and LCx.
3. Venous conduit angiography was deferred, as all three SVGs 
are known
to be chronically occluded.
 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:    
1. Left main and three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. LIMA graft to LAD with no angiographically apparent, 
flow-limiting
stenoses, with patent collaterals to RCA and LCx.

INTERPRETATION: This ___ year old IDDM man with a PMH of MI, 
CABG, CP
was referred to the lab for evaluation. The patient exercised 
for 3
minutes of a RAMP protocol and was stopped for progressive ___ 
chest
discomfort. The estimated peak MET capacity was 1.5 which 
represents a
poor functional capacity for his age. The patient reported 
progressive
___ chest pressure during low level exercise that was relieved 
with
rest and 4 l/min of oxygen via nasal canula by minute 4 of 
recovery. At
peak exercise, there was 1.5-2 mm STD in the inferolateral leads 
and 1
mm STE in aVR. These changes resolved with rest by minute 9 of
recovery. The rhythm was sinus with occasional isolated apbs and 
vpbs.
Blunted systolic BP response to exercise.
IMPRESSION: Ischemic EKG changes with anginal type symptoms at a 
low
workload. Nuclear report sent separately.

extremity. 

Radiology Report MR CERVICAL SPINE W/O CONTRAST Study Date of 
___ 5:21 AM 
IMPRESSION: 
1. Status post bilateral laminectomy and posterior fusion at 
C3-C7 with 
expected postsurgical changes. 
2. New focal expansion and increased T2 signal within the cord 
at the C3-4 
level.  Some degree of underlying myelomalacia is suspected at 
the C4-5 level. 
3. Overall improvement in the degree of spinal canal narrowing 
from C2-C7, 
with the worst level, at C2-3, displaying mild to moderate 
spinal canal 
narrowing. 

MR ___ W/O CONTRAST Study Date of ___ 3:12 ___ 
IMPRESSION: 
1. Motion limited exam. 
2. Prevertebral edema from the craniocervical junction through 
C5-C6.  No 
clear evidence for anterior longitudinal ligament edema or 
disruption, but 
evaluation is limited by motion.  No other evidence for 
ligamentous edema or bone marrow edema. 
3. From C3-C4 through C5-C6, there are disc protrusions and 
endplate 
osteophytes severely narrowing the spinal canal and compressing 
the spinal 
cord. At C6-C7, right paracentral disc protrusion endplate 
osteophytes cause moderate spinal canal narrowing with ventral 
spinal cord remodeling. There is patchy T2 hyperintensity in the 
cord from C2-C3 through C6-C7 levels, which may represent 
contusion in the setting of trauma, versus chronic myelomalacia 
in the setting of spinal canal stenosis. 
4. No evidence for acute traumatic injuries in the thoracic or 
lumbar spine. 
5. Multilevel lumbar degenerative disease.  Spinal canal 
stenosis is moderate to severe at L4-L5, and moderate at L3-L4 
and L5-S1, with crowding of the intrathecal nerve roots.  There 
is also mass effect on multiple traversing and exiting nerve 
roots, as detailed above. 
6. Trace left pleural effusion and mild bilateral dependent 
atelectasis.

lesions were seen on cardiac cath.  Her V-gram on cath revealed 
what looked like apical and inferior wall hypokinsesis.  Given 
the history of excess stress, and this v-gram our working 
diagnosis was Takotsubos cardiomyopathy.  However, when her EKG 
did not return to baseline, and she developed inferior q waves 
it was determined that she had an inferior MI with autolysis and 
early presentioin. She was started on aspirin, high dose 
atorvastatin, beta-blocker, and ACE-inhibitor for her STEMI.  
She did not have an intervention and was not started on plavix.

MRI/A Head and Neck:
No evidence for acute ischemia, mass effect, shift of normally 
midline 
structures or hydrocephalus. Brain MRA slightly limited due to 
susceptibility artifacts from PCOM clip. However, no evidence 
for focal stenosis, aneurysmal dilatation or dissection of the 
clearly visualized vessels. Normal MRA neck. 
.
HEAD CT WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: In the site of prior embolization 
for 
arteriovenous malformation in the left frontal lobe, a 2.4 x 2.5 
cm hemorrhage has occurred, and has an acute appearance (2:18). 
Superficial to this, the site of left frontal prior craniectomy 
is identified. There is no significant mass effect or shift of 
normally midline structures. There is no evidence of herniation. 
There is no evidence of hydrocephalus. There are coils in the 
left ICA at the site of previous aneurysm feeding the AVM. The 
visualized paranasal sinuses demonstrate right maxillary sinus 
opacification as well as bilateral ethmoid sinus opacification. 
Soft tissues are unremarkable. 
.  
IMPRESSION: Acute hemorrhage involving the left frontal lobe at 
the site of prior embolization of AVM. Findings posted to the ED 
dashboard at the time of scan completion and marked urgent. 
.  
NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: The left frontal hyperdensity 
noted above does not appear to reflect acute hemorrhage. Rather, 
it appears to be a combination of blood pool in dilated vessels, 
embolic material, some degree of vascular calcification, and 
perhaps hemosiderin staining of the brain. Medications On Admission: Dilantin ___

___: ECG:

Baseline artifact. Sinus rhythm. Non-specific repolarization 
abnormalities.  Q-T interval is not well seen as T wave is 
indistinct but is likely prolonged. No previous tracing 
available for comparison.  

___: CT C-spine:

1. Large hematoma centered in the right carotid space is highly 
concerning for acute injury to the right carotid artery and 
urgent CTA of the head and neck is recommended. 
2. Avulsion of the alar ligaments at the level of the dens 
raises concern for craniocervical instability.  Acute fractures 
involving the anterior posterior ring of C1.  Difficult to 
exclude injury to the transverse ligament given asymmetry at 
C1-2.  Small extra-axial hematoma at the level of C1-2. 
Recommend correlation with MRI. 
3. Skullbase and facial fractures are better described on the 
maxillofacial CT from the same date. 

___: CT Head:

1. 4 mm right cerebral subdural hematoma.  No significant 
midline shift. 
2. Tiny right cerebral subarachnoid hemorrhage and right frontal 
vertex 
contusion. 
3. Depressed, comminuted fracture of the right squamous temporal 
bone (03:24). No associated epidural hematoma. 
4. Please refer to same-day CT facial bone and CT C-spine for 
details 
regarding facial and cervical spine injuries. 

___: CXR:

Low-lying ET tube requires approximately 1-1.5 cm retraction for 
more optimal positioning.  Esophageal pH probe and orogastric 
tubes appear well positioned. 

___: Right femur x-ray: 

Displaced and angulated right midshaft femur fracture, 
comminuted.

___: CT Chest, Abdomen & Pelvis:

1. Hematoma tracks along the right common carotid artery into 
the superior 
mediastinum.  Please refer to the CTA head and neck performed on 
the same date for a complete description of injury to the right 
carotid artery. 
2. Endotracheal tube terminates 1 cm above the carina, as seen 
on chest x-ray. Slight retraction of the endotracheal tube is 
recommended. 
3. Right quadriceps hematoma is partially seen on this study, 
which is most likely related to the comminuted femoral shaft 
fracture better characterized on pelvic and femur radiographs 
from the same date.  Close clinical observation for compartment 
syndrome is recommended. 
4. Minimally displaced posterior right eleventh and twelfth rib 
fractures. 

___: CT SINUS/MANDIBLE/MAXILLOFACIAL W/O CONTRAST:

1. Multiple facial bone fractures, right greater than left with 
proptotic 
right globe and right extraconal hematoma. 
2. Mild prominence of the right lateral rectus muscle raises 
potential concern for contusion.  Straightening of the right 
optic nerve should be correlated with vision exam. 
3. Bilateral maxillary sinus fractures. 
4. Right squamous temporal bone fracture better assessed on 
same-day head CT. 

___: CTA Head & Neck:

1. Complete transection of the right internal carotid artery, 
about 2 cm above the bifurcation, with extravasation into the 
adjacent carotid sheath hematoma, causing mass effect on the 
right jugular vein.  The left ICA appears normal without 
evidence of stenosis, occlusion, or dissection.  The vertebral 
arteries appear normal bilaterally. 
2. Irregularity and narrowed caliber of the cavernous segment of 
the 
intracranial portions of the right internal carotid artery are 
concerning for dissection. 
3. Distal reconstitution of the intracranial portions of the 
right ICA is 
likely from collaterals in the left anterior and posterior 
circulation.  As such, the vessels of the circle of ___ are 
patent without stenosis, 
occlusion, or aneurysm formation. 
4. Known acute fractures of the left posterior maxillary sinus, 
anterior and posterior arch of C1, lateral wall of the right 
orbit as well as small right frontal subdural hematoma are 
better seen on the same day dedicated CT Head and Maxillofacial 
exam. 
5. Patient is intubated.  An oral catheter is also incidentally 
noted. 

___: ELBOW (AP, LAT & OBLIQUE) RIGHT PORT:

No Acute fx.

___: Left ankle x-ray:
Acute fractures involving the distal fibular shaft and medial 
malleolus.

___:  TIB/FIB (AP & LAT) LEFT:

Acute fractures involving the distal shaft fibula and medial 
malleolus.

___: MRI & MRA BRAIN AND MRA:

1. Stable small right subdural hematoma. 
2. Blood within the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles is 
more 
conspicuous than on the prior CT, which may be due to 
differences in 
modalities. 
3. Stable small right superior frontal hemorrhagic contusion 
versus 
hemorrhagic diffuse axonal injury. 
4. Several punctate foci of slow diffusion at the gray-white 
junction in the right frontal lobe may represent tiny embolic 
infarcts or nonhemorrhagic diffuse axonal injury. 
5. Small focus of hypointense signal in the left dorsal midbrain 
on gradient echo images which may represent a chronic 
microhemorrhage, as there is no associated acute diffusion 
abnormality. 
6. Diffuse bilateral sulcal FLAIR hyperintensity without 
associated 
abnormality on gradient echo images may be secondary to 
intubated status and supplemental oxygen therapy, rather than 
interval increase in previously minimal subarachnoid hemorrhage. 
 This could be clarified on follow up CT. 
7. 16 x 25 mm medially projecting pseudoaneurysm of the distal 
right cervical internal carotid artery at C2.  The internal 
carotid artery in the internal jugular vein are moderately 
compressed by the pseudoaneurysm.  Distal to the pseudoaneurysm, 
there is reconstitution of flow in the right internal carotid 
artery with normal caliber distal to the level of C2, 
representing improvement compared to ___. 
8. Turbulent flow in the proximal basilar artery. 
9. Blood within the paranasal sinuses secondary to multiple 
facial fractures, which are better demonstrated on the ___: CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEM:
Compared to a chest radiographs earlier on ___. 
  
Tip of the endotracheal tube with the chin elevated is less than 
2 cm from the carina.  It should be withdrawn 2 cm to avoid 
unilateral intubation 
particularly with chin flexion. 
  
Left subclavian line ends close to the superior cavoatrial 
junction.  
Transesophageal drainage tube loops in the stomach and passes at 
least as far as the pylorus and out of view. 
  
Previous left lower lobe peribronchial opacification has 
improved.  Lungs are essentially clear, heart size normal.  No 
pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

___ CXR :
The small left apical pneumothorax has increased slightly in 
size measuring up to 12 mm, previously 8 mm when measured with 
similar technique.  A left mid chest pigtail drainage catheter 
projects in unchanged location with associated subcutaneous 
emphysema.  Retrocardiac opacification is similar to the prior 
study and likely represents atelectasis.  There is no pulmonary 
edema.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable 

___ Chest CT :
1. When comparing with prior study, there is inversion of the 
left 
diaphragmatic, mass effect over the heart and mediastinum, and 
an increase   in the amount of left pneumothorax.  The 
pneumothorax appears to be under tension.  Of note, there is a 
kink in the left pleural drain. 
2. New left lateral chest wall subcutaneous emphysema noted. 

___ CXR :
There has been decrease in the subcutaneous emphysema throughout 
the chest 
wall.  There is again seen a left-sided chest tube with distal 
tip projecting over the lung apex.  There is a small left apical 
pneumothorax, which may have been present on the prior study.  
Endotracheal tube and feeding tube have been removed.  There is 
a left retrocardiac opacity and likely left-sided pleural 
effusion.  Right lung is clear. 

___ CXR :
Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  Substantial amount of 
subcutaneous air is present.  Left retrocardiac atelectasis is 
unchanged.  There is minimal amount of left apical pneumothorax 
suspected.  Overall no change since previous examination 
detected Medications On Admission: The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.

who presented in early labor on ___ after spontaneous
rupture of membranes.  She progressed to 8 cm at around 10
a.m. on ___ with expectant management, but cervical 
dilitation did not progress. The patient agreed to
augment her labor with Pitocin.  However, she did continue to
labor without neuraxial anesthesia.  The Pitocin was titrated
per protocol, but she did not make any cervical change for
several hours.  At this point an intrauterine pressure
catheter was recommended; the patient declined.  She did
elect for a combined spinal epidural and afterwards the
Pitocin was continued to be titrated per protocol.  However,
after 12 hours, she was still found to be 8 cm, 100%, and -1
station.  Therefore, the recommendation was made to proceed
with a primary cesarean section due to arrest.  The risks and
benefits were discussed with the patient and her partner, all
questions were answered, all consents were signed.  She had a
reassuring fetal status prior to surgery. Total EBL was 800cc.

She was transferred to the postpartum floor and then experienced 
several gushed of bright red blood mixed with clots from her 
vagina.  She was brought back to the Labor floor. Family History: Non-contributory Physical Exam: On examination during PPH, pt had bled out 400cc of blood clots 
in the bed. U/S showed some lower uterine segment clots. 
Endometrial stripe appeared adequate. Evacuated 400cc more of 
blood from lower uterine segment. She received 1000mcg of 
cytotec and 40 units of pitocin. Pt was transferred back to 
labor and delivery for continued bleeding. Medications On Admission: Prenatal vitamins

IMPRESSIONS 
___ D Esophagitis
EUS : The parenchyma in the uncinate, head, body and tail of the 
pancreas was homogenous, with a normal salt and pepper 
appearance.
Normal main pancreatic duct
The bile duct and pancreatic duct were imaged and appeared 
normal.
Mass: An ill defined, 4 cm X 6 cm irregular, hypoechoeic and 
heterogenous in echotexture was found arising from the duodenal 
wall.  The lesion involved the mucosa, submucosa and the 
muscularis.  Few ''pseudopodia'' were noted along the outer 
border of the muscularis propria - these were suspicious for 
tumor extension beyond the muscularis layer.  FNA was performed  

Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology.

___ CTA abd/pelvis 
1. Circumferential wall thickening of the third portion of the 
duodenum with
an enhancing soft tissue mass, most likely duodenal in origin. 
There is no fat plane with the otherwise normal appearing 
pancreas. Small retroperitoneal lymph nodes do not meet size 
criteria for pathologic enlargement. No other evidence of 
lymphadenopathy or local invasion.
2. Diverticulosis.
3. Please see the separately submitted report of the same day CT 
Chest forfindings above the diaphragm.

___  CT Chest with contrast 
1. A 1.5 cm low-density pulmonary lesion in the right lower lobe 
is suspicious
for Bronchocele distal to a strictured or atretic bronchus or a 
small
endobronchial mass.  Any prior imaging of the chest, including 
remote chest
radiographs should be consulted to determine its chronicity and 
the need for
further imaging.
2. Other multiple pulmonary nodules are 5 mm or less.  Some of 
the lower lobe
nodules included on prior CT abdomen and pelvis from ___ are 
larger since
then.
3. New mild pulmonary edema as evidenced by ground-glass 
opacities and
interlobular septal thickening.
4. Anterior mediastinal soft tissue lesion may be thymoma or 
thymic
hyperplasia.  If clinically indicated, consider MRI for better 
evaluation.
5. Moderate emphysema.

(stage IV) who presents with shortness of breath.
.
The patient was in her usual state of health until the evening 
before admission when she began to feel somewhat short of 
breath.  The next morning, this sensation persisted, so she 
became concerned.  She also reports a few day history of a 
non-productive cough.  Denies sick contacts, recent travel or 
sedentary lifestyle.  She denied chest pain, fever, chills, 
dizziness, lightheadedness or syncope.  She presented to the ED 
where she was found to be hypoxic to the ___ on room air.
.  
In the ED, she was placed on a non-rebreather with sats up to 
the high 90's.  Attempts were made to wean her to NC but they 
were unsuccessful, as she was satting 88% on 4L NC.  She 
remained afebrile in the ED but was found to have WBC of 17.  
Given that, she received levofloxacin and vancomycin.  Blood 
cultures were drawn prior to antibiotic administration.  CXR did 
not show PNA, but demonstrated progression of known lung cancer. 
 She underwent a CT head to rule out metastases, which was 
negative.  On transfer, patient was afebrile with HR- 77, BP- 
112/49, RR- 16, SaO2- 98% on 15L NRB  
.
On transfer to the ICU, the patient was stable and comfortable.  
Sats were 97% on 5L NC and 95% high-flow with a face-tent.

improvement in the consolidation of the superior segment of the 
right lower lobe and nodular densities of the left lower lobe.  
Still widely disseminated BAC. 
-- ___ CT Chest shows increased density of right lower lobe
consolidation and worsened peribronchiolar ground-glass 
opacities
in the lingula are most consistent with worsening of widely

with CT in six months if this patient has no history of smoking 
or malignancy.  Otherwise, a followup CT in three months is 
recommended. 
4.  Evidence of hepatic steatosis. 
5.  Mild central intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation with mild 
dilatation of the common duct, not unexpected in a patient 
status post cholecystectomy.  Left hepatic lobe pneumobilia

IMAGING/REPORTS
___ Imaging PELVIS (AP ONLY) 
FINDINGS:  
The osseous structures are diffusely demineralized which limits 
the detection of subtle fractures. The previously demonstrated 
right inferior pubic ramus fracture and right parasymphyseal 
fracture appear similar compared to the previous CT, and are 
nondisplaced. Patient's known right sacral fracture is not well 
assessed on the current exam as overlying bowel gas obscures 
assessment of the sacrum. No new fractures are otherwise 
visualized. There are mild degenerative changes of both hips 
with joint space narrowing. No dislocation is present. No 
concerning lytic or sclerotic osseous abnormalities are 
visualized.  
IMPRESSION:  Right parasymphyseal and right inferior pubic ramus 
nondisplaced fractures are unchanged. Known right sacral 
fracture is not well assessed on the current radiograph. No new 
fracture or dislocation. 

___ Imaging CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST 
FINDINGS: There is no intra-axial or extra-axial hemorrhage, 
mass, midline shift, or acute vascular territorial infarct. 
Gray-white matter differentiation is preserved. Ventricles and 
sulci are prominent compatible global volume loss. Included 
paranasal sinuses and mastoids are clear. Skull and extracranial 
soft tissues are unremarkable. 
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process. 

___ Imaging CHEST (PA & LAT) 
FINDINGS:  The lungs are clear of consolidation or vascular 
congestion. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits 
for technique. Blunting of posterior costophrenic angles could 
be due to trace effusions. Mid thoracic vertebroplasty changes 
are noted. No acute osseous abnormalities are seen. Tubular 
structure in the right upper quadrant is most likely biliary.  
IMPRESSION:  
No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Blunting of the 
posterior costophrenic angles potentially trace effusions. Medications On Admission: The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.

unremarkable.  Lungs
are clear and the pulmonary vasculature is normal.  No pleural 
effusion or
pneumothorax is seen.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
IMPRESSION:
No acute cardiopulmonary process.

CT HEAD w/o CONTRAST (___)
There is no acute hemorrhage, edema or shift of the midline
structures.  The ventricles and sulci are of normal size and 
configuration. 
The gray white matter differentiation is preserved and there is 
no evidence
for an acute territorial vascular infarction.  The basal 
cisterns are patent. 
 
There are aerosolized secretions within the posterior ethmoidal 
air cells and
minimal mucosal thickening involving the sphenoid and right 
maxillary sinuses.
The mastoid air cells are well aerated.  There is no fracture.  
Adenoids
appear enlarged for age.
 
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial process.  MRI is more sensitive for 
detecting
intracranial lesions.  
2. Aerosolized secretions within the paranasal sinuses may 
indicate acute
sinusitis in the appropriate clinical setting.
3. Posterior nasopharyngeal mucosal thickening should be further 
evaluated
with direct visualization.

CT TORSO (___)

pole of the left
kidney is too small to characterize but statistically likely a 
simple cyst.  
 
The small and large bowel are within normal limits, without 
evidence of wall
thickening or dilatation to suggest obstruction.  The appendix 
is visualized
and is not inflamed.  The aorta and its main branches are patent

for a few minutes after using the restroom, while washing her
hands, she felt the dizziness come back.  Dizziness was similar
to yesterday, described as a combination of disequilibrium, gait
unsteadiness, with some room spinning component.  It was more
severe than usual.  She sat down and put her head in her hands,
covering her eyes.  She felt significantly nauseous but did not
vomit.  She sat in the chair but that it did not help.  There

last day, this left ear sensation has been somewhat more
prominent than usual.  She otherwise denies any new symptoms,
including denying focal weakness, sensory changes, visual

candidate given time to presentation. Went for thrombectomy, but 
this was aborted due to tortuosity of his carotids. MRI scan 
showed Large L-MCA acute infarction with significant involvement 
of broca's and Wernicke's area. Exam w/ dense global aphasia, 
L-gaze preference, RUE>RLE weakness. Unable to pass speech and 
swallow evaluation.
Etiology most likely thromboembolic due to carotid disease, 
given history of previous L-MCA, versus cardioembolic. 
Additional possibility includes retrograde extension of prior M2 
clot.
Risk factor eval with TSH 1.2. HbA1C 5.4%. LDL 55. Normal TTE. 
He has had a stroke despite DAPT and will need to be considered 
for AC in the future, this was not started in the inpatient 
setting due to large stroke size. He was ultimately felt to 
require PEG tube. By the end of his hospitalization, he was able 
to safely swallow and was transitioned back to a ground diet.

Discharge Exam summarized:
Alert, tracks, regards, follows no commands. Some nonsensical 
verbal output. Forcefully antigravity bilaterally. 

Transitional Issues
===================
[] blood pressure goals: normal blood pressure, we had to hold 
metoprolol succinate and Imdur as cannot be crushed via PEG 
tube. patient transitioned to metop tartrate, plan to uptitrate 
for goal normal blood pressure.
[] ___
[] Consider AC in the outpatient setting at stroke follow up 
appointment pending results of ___ and given that had 
stroke through aspirin/clopidogrel
[] TTE demonstrated LVH and elevated pulmonary pressures, 
consider routine right heart function 
 evaluation
[] Schedule for PEG tube removal if patient is able to maintain 
caloric intake by oral means
[] Patient noted to have a rash on his trunk, evaluated by 
dermatology felt to be a drug rash secondary to fluoxetine. This 
medication was discontinued, please montitor for improvement

"IMPRESSION:
1. Multiple, partially imaged small bowel loops, fluid-filled 
and dilated to
approximately 3.2 cm, with a relatively decompressed terminal 
ileum.  These
findings can be seen in the setting of a gastroenteritis,

small-bowel
obstruction is not definitely excluded.  Further assessment with 
CT imaging of
the pelvis may be helpful for further evaluation.

The enteric tube extends below the level of diaphragm, with the 
tip projecting
over the stomach."

CTA Chest ___:
IMPRESSION:
1. Acute, nonocclusive thrombus within the left pulmonary artery

1.1 cm nodular opacity projecting over the left mid lung not 
seen on the prior study. Recommend outpatient chest CT for 
further evaluation for possible pulmonary nodule.Slight blunting 
of the posterior left costophrenic angle may relate to 
hyperinflation but trace pleural effusion not excluded 

Chest CT:
1. Possible nodule in the left mid lung reported on recent chest 
radiograph does not have a correlate on CT and may represent 
costochondral calcification shadows. Biapical pleuroparenchymal 
scarring. 
2. Focal esophageal wall thickening in the upper/mid segment 
should be 
correlated with direct visualization. 
3. Heterogeneous left thyroid lobe can be further evaluated with 
ultrasound if clinically indicated. 

CT abdomen Pelvis:
No acute intra-abdominal process and no significant change 
compared to the prior examination. 2. Whirling of the abdominal 
mesentery without evidence of obstruction or ischemia is of 
unclear significance. 

CT head: No acute intracranial abnormality

MRI Head: No acute infarction. Stable chronic supratentorial 
white matter and pons signal abnormalities are most likely 
sequela of chronic small vessel ischemic disease, given the 
patient's age. Otherwise, motion limited exam without evidence 
for other acute abnormalities or mass 

EEG ___: This is an abnormal video-EEG monitoring session 
because of 
rhythmic delta activity which evolves and lasts up to 30 seconds 
notably 
during sleep, occasional generalized bifrontally predominant 
discharges, and rare bioccipital discharges. The background 
slowing is indicative of global cerebral dysfunction with areas 
of focal neuronal dysfunction and cortical irritability. These 
findings are concerning for an epileptiform encephalopathy with 
recurrent brief nonconvulsive seizures which self-resolve. The 
record improves towards the latter half of the study. 

EEG ___:
This is an abnormal video-EEG monitoring session because of 
occasional rhythmic delta activity, with periods of triphasic 
wNaves 
morphology, which waxes and wanes notably during sleep, and rare 
isolated 
independent and very rare synchronous bitemporal discharges. 
These findings indicate global cerebral dysfunction along with 
focal cortical irritability in both temporal regions. The former 
can be seen in conditions such as toxic metabolic 
encephalopathy. The background slowing is notably improved and 
is likely indicative of generalized mild encephalopathy. No 
electrographic seizures are recorded. Overall, this is a 
significantly improved record as compared to the prior study.

IMAGING
=======
___ CXR PA/L:  
Enlarged cardiomediastinal silhouette. Mild pulmonary vascular 
congestion. Subtle right base opacity most likely relates to 
vascular congestion although underlying infection is difficult 
to exclude.  

___ NCHCT:  
No acute intracranial process. Possible subtle ectasia of the 
distal left vertebral artery and proximal basilar artery.  
EKG: NSR @ 69 bpm, normal axis, incomplete RBBB, LVH w/ 
secondary repolarization abnormalities, LAE  

___ Renal artery Doppler:
No evidence of renal artery stenosis in the left kidney and 
likely no stenosis in the right kidney however the Doppler 
examination is somewhat limited due to the patient's limited 
ability to hold his breath. 

___ TTE:
The left atrial volume index is moderately increased. The 
estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. There is severe 
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular 
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic 
function is mildly depressed (Quantitative (biplane) LVEF = 46%) 
secondary to mild global hypokinesis with slightly worse 
function of the basal-mid inferior and inferoseptal walls. 
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular 
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size 
and free wall motion are normal. The right ventricular free wall 
is hypertrophied. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus 
level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch is 
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear 
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic 
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are 
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild 
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary 
artery systolic hypertension. The end-diastolic pulmonic 
regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery 
diastolic hypertension. There is a very small pericardial 
effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade. 

 IMPRESSION: Severe concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
mildly depressed global and regional systolic dysfunction and 
increased filling pressure. Mild mitral regurgitation. Mild 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild dilatation of the 
ascending aorta and arch. Very small pericardial effusion.

 Findings are suggestive of hypertensive myopathy (with possible 
underlying CAD), although an infiltrative process cannot be 
excluded. Medications On Admission: None

have an embolization by interventional radiology and stop all
estrogen based therapy.

She underwent the embolization today with interventional
radiology they did an embolization of the right lobe via the
right radial access.  After the procedure she was noted to have
some mild chest tightness that they thought was likely
diaphragmatic irritation. She was also noted to have a mild rash

CT CHEST ___:  IMPRESSION:  
  
1. Extensive, confluent, bilateral airspace consolidations, most 
appreciable in the right middle and lower lobes, suggestive of 
pneumonia. 
2. Small right pleural effusion without rim. 
3. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy, likely reactive in nature. 
4. Contrast opacification of the esophagus suggesting reflux.  
Although not necessarily related to pneumonia, the possibility 
of aspiration as an 
underlying cause could also be considered in the appropriate 
setting in 
addition to community acquired pneumonia. 
5.  Emphysema. 

TTE ___: Conclusions  
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. 
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion 
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular 
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The right 
ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall 
contractility. The aortic valve is not well seen. The mitral 
valve leaflets are not well seen. Trivial mitral regurgitation 
is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be 
determined. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. 


IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal left ventricular 
cavity size with low normal global systolic function in the 
setting of marked tachycardia. Right ventricular cavity dilation 
with free wall hypkinesis. Valvular anatomy and function could 
not be assessed, but severe aortic stenosis and mitral stenosis 
do not appear to be present.   

RUQ US ___: IMPRESSION: 
1. Echogenic liver consistent with steatosis. Other forms of 
liver disease including hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis or 
steatohepatitis cannot be excluded on the basis of this 
examination. 
2. Moderate amount of ascites and a small right pleural effusion 

3. Nonobstructing right-sided nephrolithiasis. Limited 
evaluation of the left kidney.

IMAGING/STUDIES:
================

CXR (___) (___): 
Low lung inflation with bilateral opacity, L>R, likely 
reflecting combination of atelectasis and/or infiltrate as well 
as pleural fluid. 
-Bilateral femoral/popliteal ultrasound (___) (___): 
No evidence of acute DVT in either extremity

CTA Chest (___) (___): 
1. No evidence of PE
2. Large bilateral pleural effusions with associated bibasilar 
atelectasis
3. Multifocal groundglass and nodular opacities bilaterally, 
suspicious for multifocal PNA superimposed upon atelectasis. 
There is mediastinal and left axillary lymphadenopathy. 

CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis with Contrast (___)
IMPRESSION:   
1. Near completely occlusive thrombus in the SVC which extends 
to left 
brachiocephalic vein, which is completely occluded. 
2. A separate thrombus is identified in the right atrial 
appendage. 
3. Multifocal pulmonary opacities concerning for multifocal 
pneumonia. 
Malignancy cannot be excluded. 
4. Large bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis. 

5. 1.5 cm nodule is identified in the right lobe of the thyroid. 
 Nonemergent ultrasound is recommended for further evaluation. 
6. 1.1 cm hypodense lesion in the pancreatic head is likely 
IPMN.  MRCP for further assessment. 
7. Moderate pelvic fluid is intermediate density and may reflect 
complex or exudative fluid. 
8. Anasarca.   
RECOMMENDATION(S):  Nonemergent thyroid ultrasound. Consider 
MRCP for further evaluation of cystic lesion in the pancreatic 
head. 

Upper Extremity Doppler ___
IMPRESSION:    
Deep vein thrombus seen within the lower portion of the right 
internal jugular vein and also within the left internal jugular 
vein and subclavian vein.  The findings are similar to the chest 
CT the performed ___. 

CXR ___
IMPRESSION:    
In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and 
support devices have been removed.  Continued low lung volumes 
with increasing left pleural effusion and compressive 
atelectasis at the base.  The cardiac silhouette is within upper 
limits of normal in size, though there is indistinctness of 
engorged pulmonary vessels consistent with pulmonary vascular 
congestion.   
Asymmetric perihilar opacification on the left raises the 
possibility of 
superimposed aspiration or infectious pneumonia in this region. 

TTE ___
The left atrial volume index is normal. No atrial septal defect 
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial 
pressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and 
cavity size are normal. There is severe global left ventricular 
hypokinesis (biplane LVEF = 26 %). Systolic function of apical 
segments is relatively preserved. No intraventricular thrombi 
are seen. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left 
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular 
chamber size is normal with severe global free wall hypokinesis. 
Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion is depressed (1.1 cm) 
consistent with right ventricular systolic dysfunction. The 
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are 
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal 
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic 
regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic 
valve. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There 
is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on 
the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There 
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no 
pericardial effusion. There is a very prominent/large left 
pleural effusion. 
 IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity size with severe global 
biventricular hypokinesis most c/w diffuse process/non-ischemic 
cardiomyopathy (e.g., toxin, metabolic, etc.) Moderate pulmonary 
artery hypertension. Increased PCWP.
 CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: 
 The left ventricular ejection fraction is <40%, a threshold for 
which the patient may benefit from a beta blocker and an ACE 
inhibitor or ___. 
 Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
the findings are similar.

radiation, doxorubicin, Adriamycin), active drug use, who 
presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure and cardiogenic 
shock. 

#Cardiogenic Shock: 
#Systolic Congestive Heart Failure:
Over the past few months pt had multiple ED visits for shortness 
of breath, which were treated as CAP or asthma. He presented to 
an OSH in cardiogenic shock with volume overload as evidenced by 
CXR and diffuse anasarca, with EF depressed to 15%. Pt arrived 
to ___ already intubated. Of note he had a history of cardiac 
dysfunction dating back to his chemotherapy/radiation as a 
child, and had not been taking any of his cardiac meds. Last EF 
was normal in ___, though EF was depressed to 35% with infusion 
of dobutamine during a ___ stress echo. For his heart failure 
he was started on a Lasix drip, and intermittently required 
levophed and inotropic support with dobutamine. He exhibited 
brisk diuresis with large volume UOP. He was successfully 
extubated on ___. His Lasix was transitioned to 80 mg PO 
Lasix, and he was started on low doses of metoprolol and ACE 
inhibitor. EF recovered to 26% prior to discharge with ECHO 
showing global hypokinesis. Ultimately he likely had a 
preexisting cardiomyopathy that was worsened in the setting of 
recreational drug use (benzos and cocaine positive on 
admission). 

#Coagulopathy
#SVC syndrome
#RA Thrombus
In the setting of unclear etiology of decompensation, a CT torso 
was obtained which was notable for thrombus extending from left 
brachiocephalic vein into SVC. A large thrombus is also present 
in the right atrium. He was treated with a heparin drip, which 
was transitioned to rivaroxaban prior to discharge. 

#Substance abuse: per patient's family, long history of IVDU, 
"buying pills on the street", and EtOH abuse. Tox screen (+) 
cocaine, (+) benzos. No evidence of withdrawal while in-house. 
Started on thiamine, folate, MVI.

#Multifocal pulmonary consolidations: 
CTA from ___ negative for PE, CT torso at ___ notable 
for multifocal consolidations in bilateral lungs c/w septic 
emboli vs PNA. TTE did not suggest tricuspid endocarditis. Pt 
was initially treated with vanc/zosyn for possible pneumonia, 
but these were discontinued on ___ given his clinical 
improvement and with input from the infectious disease team. 
Infectious workup (including all cultures and HIV test) was 
non-revelatory.

complications.
Findings
 Elevated left and right heart filling pressures.
 Moderate coronary coronary artery disease.
 Failed surgical aortic valve with severe aortic regurgitation
 Possible mitral valve regurgitation through TMVR
 Severe triscuspid regrugitation
Recommendations
 Maximize medical therapy
 CSURG consult
 TEE (Is AI valvular or paravalvular)
 CTA (sizing of valve and position of the coronaries
TEE ___:
CONCLUSION:
There is no spontaneous echo contrast in the body of the left 
atrium. There is mild spontaneous echo contrast in the left 
atrial appendage. No thrombus/mass is seen in the body of the 
left atrium/left atrial appendage.
The left atial appendage ejection velocity is very depressed. No 
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the 
right atrium/right atrial appendage. The right atrial appendage 
ejection velocity is depressed. There is no evidence for an 
atrial septal defect by 2D/color Doppler. Overall left 
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed. Mildly 
dilated right ventricular cavity with mild global free wall 
hypokinesis. Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is 
likely lower due to the severity of tricuspid regurgitation. 
There are no aortic arch atheroma with simple atheroma in the 
descending aorta to 40cm from the incisors. An aortic valve 
bioprosthesis is present. The prosthesis is well seated with 
thickened leaflets but normal gradient. No masses or vegetations 
are seen on the aortic valve. No abscess is seen. There is a 
valvular jet of moderate to severe [3+] aortic regurgitation. 
There is ___ 3 TMVR prosthesis. The prosthesis is 
well-seated, with
thin/mobile leaflets and high normal mean gradient. No masses or 
vegetations are seen on the mitral valve. No abscess is seen. 
There is a valvular and paravalvular jet of trivial mitral 
regurgitation. The tricuspid valve leaflets appear structurally 
normal. No mass/vegetation are seen on the tricuspid valve. No 
abscess is seen. There is moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation. 
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
IMPRESSION: Well seated bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis 
with thickened leaflets and moderate to severe valvular 
regurgitation. Well seated bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis 
(TMVR) with thin/mobile leaflets and very mild valvular and 
paravalvular regurgitation. Right
ventricular cavity dilation with free wall hypokinesis. Moderate 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Moderate tricuspid 
regurgitation.
Cardiac Structure/Morph ___:
IMPRESSION:  
Status post aortic and mitral valve replacements, now here for 
possible TAVR procedure. Dilated right and left atrium and right 
ventricle.  Severe coronary atherosclerotic disease. The left 
appendage is not filled with contrast on the current study which 
could be related either to a thrombus or slowed filling. If 
clinical concern exists, an echocardiogram can better assess 
this finding. Patent femoral and subclavian arteries bilaterally 
with largest lumen diameter in the left femoral and left 
subclavian arteries. 
  
Scaterred pulmonary nodules surrounded by ground glass opacities 
and mild 
interlobular septal thickening.  These are attributable to 
pulmonary edema 
with possible superimposed infection. 
TAVR Report ___:
Interventional Details
Complications: There were no clinically significant 
complications.
 Successful TAVR: A 26 mm Evolut with proper fluoroscopic 
loading was then advanced to the aortic valve. The valve was 
deployed under TEE and fluoro guidance and using and placement 
of a Pigtail catheter was usedto demonstrate the position of the 
Evolut 2 mm below the prosthetic frame. After final deployment, 
there was none-trace aortic regurgitation by TEE. The gradient 
was <5 mmHg across the valve with some LVOT gradient 
The right groin was closed with a two Proglide in a Pre-Close
fashion and an angioseal.
The left femoral artery was closed with a ___ Fr Angioseal. 
IMPRESSION: Well-seated, normally functioning ___ 3 aortic 
bioprosthesis within a ___ bioprosthetic aortic valve. Mild 
resting LVOT obstruction without inducible gradient increase. 
Bioprosthetic mitral valve with elevated transmitral pressure 
gradient. Severe biatrial enlargement. Preserved left 
ventricular systolic function. Dilated, mildly hypokinetic right 
ventricle. Severe tricuspid regurgitation. Severe pulmonary 
hypertension. Compared with the prior TTE (images reviewed) of 
___, the ___ 3 aortic bioprosthesis is new. The 
tranmitral pressure gradient has increased (previously 10 mmHg). 
The severity of tricuspid regurgitation is higher. The pulmonary 
pressure has increased. LVEF 65%. AV Peak/Mean 29 mmHg/15 mmHg.

involving the of the C3 and C4 vertebrae which are slightly
expanded. 
2. Secondary severe canal narrowing with cord compression from
the C3-4 through C4-5 level with associated cord signal
abnormality. 
3. Additional metastatic lesion involving the left C4-C5 through
C5-C6 facets with soft tissue extension as well. 
4. Multilevel severe left neural foraminal narrowing is seen at
C3-C4, C4-C5, and C5-C6. 
5. Multilevel degenerative changes of the lumbar spine are most

metastatic disease.

ACUTE/ACTIVE PROBLEMS:
# Squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity with metastasis
# Flaccid paralysis
# Cerebellar stroke
# Severe cord compression at C3-4: 

Patient with history of squamous cell carcinoma of the oral 
cavity s/p chemoXRT now with evidence of recurrence and 
metastatic disease in including extensive osseous metastatic 
disease involving the cervical spine with narrowing of the 
spinal canal at C3-4 with marked cord compression, likely 
causing his flaccid paralysis. He was treated with IV 
dexamethasone while in house. Neurosurgery is not offering 
surgical intervention based on entire clinical picture. Oncology 
was consulted and agreed with patient's prognosis and 
recommended CMO. Palliative radiation was discussed with health 
care proxy and was not within goals of care. He was also found 
to have cerebellar stroke, for which neurology was consulted; 
further work up was not within goals of care.

Social Work, Legal and Palliative Care were consulted to assist 
with goals of care.G iven the aggressive nature of his 
malignancy, CPR and intubation would likely be futile. The 
various medical teams have recommended ___ care and 
hospice. The patient's HCP, ___, feels that the patient would 
want to go back to his group
home and receive hospice care there. She, however, wants Mr. 
___ to remain full code as she believes that this is his 
wish. She stated that he has been neglected and mistreated his 
entire life and in this last phase of his life, she wants to 
make
sure that his wishes are respected and honored. She would like 
to readdress this at hospice after she discusses it with Mr. 
___ however we discussed with her that it is unlikely that 
she would be able to have a meaningful conversation with Mr. 
___. 

We have identified a hospice agency that will accept the patient 
as full code. 
In terms of medications, he will be discharged on morphine 5mg 
of oral concentrated solution 20mg/ml q4h scheduled for pain 
control, and would consider Ativan 0.25 mg q6H PRN for anxiety 
(oral concentrated form). He was receiving IV acetaminophen 
while in house for pain, and this will be transitioned to PR 
formulation.  

With regard to PO, patient is at very high risk for aspiration 
given mental status and medical condition, and at present he is 
unable to swallow. Given that the overall wish is for patient to 
be able to go to hospice at his group home such that patient may 
pass away there comfortably, we specifically discussed with HCP 
only administering medications for pain and anxiety in oral 
concentrated form, and that upon discharge, we would discontinue 
his dexamethasone. In the same vein, we also discussed 
artificial nutrition and hydration with ___. TPN is not 
indicated; we feel that it would not be appropriate to place a 
surgical G-tube or that the patient would tolerate a NGT- nor 
would these interventions be consistent with patient's stated 
goals. While we agreed that while we would continue IVF while he 
is in
house, he would not longer be receiving IV hydration as this is 
generally not provided when patients are on hospice care. She 
understood.  
Hence, he will be NPO except for oral morphine and Ativan in 
concentrated form; this was discussed with ___ who was in 
agreement.

# Hyponatremia: Suspect hypovolemic, resolved with IVF.

# Possible acute kidney injury: Unknown baseline Cr, now 1.3 on 
admission. ___ be some degree of pre-renal azotemia. S/p IVF 
with improvement.

# Leukocytosis: Patient afebrile, UA bland, CXR without 
pneumonia, skin without infection. Suspect due to malignancy.

# Hypercalcemia: Suspect due to malignancy.

CHRONIC/STABLE PROBLEMS:
# Depression:
- Hold citalopram

# GERD: 
- Hold omeprazole

# Osteoporosis:
- Hold Vitamin D

# BPH:
- Hold tamsulosin

heart attack who presents with acute onset shoulder pain of 5 
days duration. The pain became worse the day after onset, and he 
presented to the emergency room where he was ruled out for a 
myocardial infarction. Aspiration of the joint yielded no fluid. 
The patient went to his primary care provider who referred him 
to orthopedics, where he was ordered an MRI. His MRI the day 
prior to admission showed diffuse edema of his deltoid and 
trapezius muscles. The patient finds that any sort of movement 
causes the pain to be much worse. He took some motrin and 
percocet at home which provided some relief ___ -> ___ pain.  

  
Of note, the patient reports that several months ago he had what 
was a presumed gout attack in his hands that his son, an ER 
physician prescribed him prednisone. This entirely resolved his 
symptoms, but a definitive diagnosis was never made. He denies 
any recent upper respiratory symptoms, fevers, chills, or other 
symptoms at home. He has not had any recent medication changes. 
He has no history of trauma or abnormal movement of his shoulder 
and cannot remember any injury to that area.  
In the ED, initial VS were 98 69 88/54 18 100%; The patient 
received morphine and percocet with mild improvement of his 
pain. His creatinine was also found to be elevated at 2.1 from 4 
days prior.

IMAGING
MRI SHOULDER ___
IMPRESSION: Trace fluid in the acromioclavicular joint with 
minimal 
irregularity of the articular surfaces and large amount of edema 
in the 
trapezius and deltoid muscles. The spectrum of findings could be 
seen in the setting of acute injury as in a grade 1 sprain of 
the acromioclavicular joint. 
However, given the absence of any history of trauma the findings 
are 
consistent with nonspecific myositis of the trapezius and 
deltoid muscles.  Given the trace amount of fluid in the 
acromioclavicular joint superimposed infection in this region 
cannot be excluded. The amount of fluid would not be amenable to 
image-guided joint aspiration. This would be an atypical 
location for diabetic myonecrosis. 

EKG ___
Sinus rhythm. Non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities. Cannot 
exclude ischemia. Compared to the previous tracing of ___ T 
wave abnormalities are more prominent in leads V2-V4. 

US LEFT SHOULDER ___
There is no evidence of focal fluid collection around the region 
of pain. No soft tissue calcifications are identified. 

MR THIGHS ___
IMPRESSION: Myositis involving the left quadriceps groups, most 
severely 
affecting the left vastus lateralis and vastus medialis as 
detailed above.  Differential considerations include infectious 
and inflammatory myositis, including drug reaction, as well as 
diabetic myonecrosis. No evidence of focal fluid collection or 
other sign of abscess formation.

our
Neuro ICU from ___ on ___ after he was found to
be in status epilepticus.  He has a medical history significant
for HTN, HLD, psoriasis, chronic back pain on home opiates,
question of alcohol abuse, but no prior history of seizures.  
Per
report from his wife, he had been feeling well on ___.  He went
to bed and woke up at 7:30AM complaining of left knee pain while
he was in bed.  He apparently accidentally rolled out of bed by
accident, and when his wife found him on the floor, he had
labored breathing and appeared confused briefly.  Shortly after
this episode he returned to baseline and was able to get back up
into bed, go to the bathroom and prepare a cup of coffee without
further deficit.  Around 9AM, however, he had a subsequent event
while seated in a chair watching TV.  Per report, he shouted the
phrase "Dont leave" after which he had a fixed gaze forward that
was associated with whole-body stiffening.  This developed into
bilateral arm shaking with a tongue bite that lasted ___ 
minutes.
His wife called EMS and by the time they arrived, his posture
improved but he was confused and unable to converse.  En route 
to
the hospital, EMTs reported that he had return to baseline 
mental
status.  At ___, however, he had a prolonged witnessed 
GTC
seizure in the ED that was refractory to 6 mg ativan.  It is
unclear how long he seized, but subsequently he was loaded with
dilantin and then intubated/sedated with propafol for seizure
control.   Broad spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, cefepime,
acyclovir) for meningitis coverage were started and NCHCT was
done which showed no abnormality.

By the time he arrived to ___ he had no seizures.   MRI showed
no abnormalities, EEG showed diffuse slowing but no seizures, 
and
LP (0 WBCs) was unremarkable.  Phenytoin trough was found to be
low and a decision was made to transition Dilantin to Keppra
1000mg BID.  He was successfully extubated on ___ and mental
status.  He was placed on CIWA scale ___ for agitation and
tremulousness, though secondary to possible alcohol withdrawal. 
Incidentally he was found to have a humeral fracture which was
repaired by orthopedics on ___.

With respect to seizure history there is no known head trauma.

Images:  
___ CT abd/pelvis: 
1. Findings are consistent with choledocholithiasis and 
associated biliary obstruction.  Suggestion of mild intrahepatic 
biliary ductal dilatation.  There is dilation of the 
extrahepatic portion of the CBD which measures 1.4 cm.  Within 
the distal CBD right at the level of the ampulla there is an 
obstructing gall stone measuring 1.3 x 1.4 x 1.4 cm.
2. Cirrhotic appearance to the liver with the presence of a 
subtle hypodense focus within the left lobe (0.8 x 1.1 x 1.3cm). 
The possibility of a neoplastic focus needs to be excluded.
3. Bilateral atrophic kidneys.
4. Extensive abdominal aortic vascular disease involving the 
mesenteric vessels, renal arteries, and iliac arteries which are 
aneurysmally dilated. Evaluation limited by non-contrast scan.
5. Coronary artery disease.
6. Mitral valve calcifications.
7. Cholelithiasis.
8. Sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence for diverticulitis.
9. Degenerative changes in the lumbar spine.
.
___ CXR: There is calcified granuloma in the right lower chest 
peripherally unchanged. Minimal atelectasis is seen at the left 
lateral sulcus, this may reflect an element of scarring as it is 
similar to that seen previously. The left hemidiaphragm is 
slightly elevated.  The right lung is otherwise clear.  The 
heart is upper normal in size.  There is no CHF.

Echo ___: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated 
right atrial pressure is ___. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is 
normal. LV systolic function appears globally depressed 
(ejection fraction approximately 30 percent), with regional 
variation (the posterior and lateral walls contract better than 
the rest of the ventricle). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an 
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There 
is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is 
dilated with depressed free wall contractility. The aortic root 
is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is 
mildly dilated. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The 
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is a 
minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic 
valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral 
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve 
prolapse. There is severe mitral annular calcification. At least 
moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic 
shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation is likely 
significantly UNDERestimated.] The left ventricular inflow 
pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with 
elevated left atrial pressure. The tricuspid valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. The supporting structures of the tricuspid 
valve are thickened/fibrotic. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid 
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery 
systolic hypertension. The main pulmonary artery is dilated. The 
branch pulmonary arteries are dilated. There is no pericardial 
effusion. 

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) 
of ___, the left ventricular ejection fraction is 
further decreased, and the mitral and tricuspid regurgitation 
are significantly increased  

ERCP ___: 
Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a 
Clever Cut sphincterotome using a free-hand technique. 
A single 15mm filling defect consistent with a calcified round 
stone that was causing partial obstruction was seen at the lower 
___ile duct. There was post-obstructive 
dilation.  
A biliary sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock 
position using a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.  
A ___ by 7cm Cotton ___ biliary stent was placed 
successfully. 
Diverticulum in the distal duodenal bulb

___ ECG:
Atrial fibrillation. Leftward axis. Intraventricular conduction 
delay. 
Inferior myocardial infarction, age undetermined. T wave 
inversions in 
leads I, aVL, as well as leads V2-V6 may be due to left 
ventricular 
hypertrophy, although the contour also is consistent with 
coronary ischemia and should be considered strongly. Clinical 
correlation is suggested.  Compared to the previous tracing of 
___ repolarization abnormalities are new and the rate has 
increased.

quickly responded to IM Glucagon, and buccal glucose gel with 
FSBG trending to ___, 80s, then 100s. Remainder of the day 
patient was at his baseline, ate a full breakfast, and lunch.  
We informed the patient that watching his blood glucose for 
another 24hours would be preferrable, however, the patient 
insisted on leaving for personal/family reasons. We discussed at 
length that he needs to have someone with him for the next ___ 
hours (his wife said she would be), that he needs to monitor his 
FSBG every ___ hours (his wife stated that she would), that he 
needs to make sure to do PD with his normal equipment at his

C.CATH Study Date of ___ 1. Selective coronary angiography 
of this right dominant system revealed one vessel CAD. The LMCA 
was patent. The LAD was patent, but with slow flow suggestive of 
microvascular dysfunction and tortuous terminal vessels. The LCX 
was patent but with slow flow and tortuous terminal vessels. 
There was a single large OM2 and a modest LPL/OM5. The RCA had a 
short horizontal origin with early upward shepherd's crook bend. 
The distal RCA was diffusely small in caliber (suggestive of a 
spontaneous arterial dissection with a secondary hematoma 
compressing the lumen), with up to 75% narrowing extending to 
hazy filling defect at origin of RPDA/bifurcation with small 
distal AV groove RCA. There was a tortuous hairpin turn in the 
mid RPDA. 2. Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated mildly 
elevated LVEDP of 15 mmHg and normal systemic arterial 
pressures. There was no transaortic gradient on catheter 
pullback from LV to aorta. 3. Left ventriculography demonstrated 
global hypokinesis, worse inferiorly and inferoapically. The 
calculated LVEF was 47%. There was no non-ectopic mitral 
regurgitation. 4. Successful PTCA and placement of bare-metal 
stents in the RCA were performed. The procedure was complicated 
by proximal-mid RCA dissection. Overlapping bare-metal stents 
were placed in the RCA (proximal-to-distal), with 4.0x12 mm 
Vision, 3.5x18 mm Driver, 3.0x30 mm Driver, 3.0x30 mm Driver, 
2.5x24 mm Micro Driver, 2.5x8 mm Micro Driver, and 2.25x24 mm 
Micro Driver.  Final angiography showed TIMI 2 flow in the RCA, 
slightly slow flow in the jailed AM branches, no residual 
stenoses in the stents, a slight amount of contrast staining 
outside of the proximal stents due to the dissection, and a mild 
(grade B) dissection in the proximal RPDA (See ___ Comments). 
5. Limited angiography of the right femoral artery showed the 
arteriotomy puncture site in the body of the right common 
femoral artery.  There was a corrugated appearance of the common 
femoral artery and the superficial femoral artery that was 
suggestive of fibromuscular dysplasia.  A 6 ___ Angioseal VIP 
was deployed successfully with good hemostasis. 6. Monitoring 
for radiation-induced skin injury is recommended given nominal 
IRP fluoroscopic skin exposure >4 Gy. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. One 
vessel coronary artery disease, possibly due to spontaneous 
arterial dissection. 
2. Mild diffuse, heterogeneous left ventricular systolic 
dysfunction. 3. Mild left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. 4. 
Placement of bare-metal stents in the distal RCA. 5. PCI 
complicated by proximal-mid RCA dissection that was successfully 
rescued by placement of additional bare metal stents. 6. 
Possible fibromuscular dysplasia, based on the angiographic 
appearance of the right CFA and SFA. 7. Successful Angioseal 
closure of the right femoral arteriotomy. 8. Monitoring for 
radiation-induced skin injury is recommended given nominal IRP 
fluoroscopic skin exposure >4 Gy. 
.
TTE (Complete) Done ___ at 8:25:18 AM The left atrium is 
mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. 
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left 
ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%) secondary 
to hypokinesis of the inferior and posterior walls. There is no 
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and 
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) 
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no 
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally 
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral 
valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure 
is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

edema, widespread pneumonia, or even ARDS. Extensive respiratory 
motion somewhat blurs the resulting image. 

CXR ___:
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no 
relevant change. Extensive bilateral diffuse parenchymal 
opacities at low lung volumes and minimal pleural effusions. The 
image is consistent with ARDS. Moderate cardiomegaly. No 
interval recurrence of new parenchymal opacities.

___, ischemic cardiomyopathy, HTN, CKD, interstitial lung 
disease who presented to the ED with concerns of syncope without 
clear prodrome. Starting 6 months ago, he began having episodes 
where he would wake up in a different spot than where he went to 
sleep and he would have difficulty getting up. For most recent 
episode: pt was rolling over in bed at 5AM he lost consciousness 
and woke up on floor next to bed. Subsequently he tried to get 
up but had difficulty though he denies specific weakness in his 
arms or legs. He held onto the bed and as after he stood up, he 
saw what looks like "circuits" with lines flashing in front of 
his eyes. It happened about x4 times and then went away. Then he 
felt cramping of his calf, but no shaking, and he was able to 
get himself to a chair. He states that he had a sensation of 
"something serious" happening but denies epigastric rising, 
auditory hallucinations or metallic taste. No loss or bowel or 
bladder. He also reports that he has occasional hallucinations 
of his family members who have passed away. For workup: ICD 
interrogated without evidence of firing or record of 
tachyarrhythmia. Echo with LVEF ___ dilated left ventricle 
with severe regional systolic dysfunction, c/w multivessel CAD. 
Mild mitral regurgitation. Unchanged from prior in ___. CTA 
showed no PE and stable interstitial lung disease consistent 
with prior. CT head negative for acute intracranial process. 
Found to be orthostatic, so given 1L of fluids over course of 
admission with resolution of orthostasis. Given history, 
neurology consulted and recommended 24 hour EEG which showed 
temporal slowing but no obvious epileptiform changes. History 
has some features concerning for alpha-synucleinopathy such as 
___ disease ___ body disorder which may explain his 
hallucination, orthostasis and REM sleep disorder such as sleep 
walking. Should follow up the results of his EEG with a 
neurologist by calling the Neurology Urgent Care Line to 
schedule an appointment at ___.

___ from outside hospital shows L caudate bleed as above

CXR: possible PNA

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  ___ 1:09 ___
The findings are essentially unchanged from the head CT from 
___, done approximately three hours earlier; there 
is an acute hemorrhage centered in the left basal ganglia, 
measuring 4.7 x 2.0 cm with surrounding vasogenic edema and 
slight, 3 mm midline shift. There is no new focus of bleeding. 
Again, there is effacement of the left lateral ventricle, but 
the ventricles, sulci and cisterns are otherwise normal and 
unchanged. No significant sinus mucosal disease or opacification 
of mastoid air cells.

IMPRESSION: Unchanged appearance of large left basal ganglia 
bleed with slight midline shift.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  ___ 9:43 AM
FINDINGS: In comparison with the prior study, a left basal 
ganglia hemorrhage with associated surrounding edema is again 
visualized; the core of hemorrhagic foci measures approximately 
18 x 40 mm in size. Stable midline shifting is demonstrated with 
approximately 3 mm of midline shifting, no new areas of 
hemorrhage are demonstrated, persistent effacement of the left 
lateral ventricle; however, no significant effacement of the 
sulci or perimesencephalic cisterns is noted. The bony 
structures and soft tissues appear unremarkable. Minimal mucosal 
thickening is observed in the ethmoidal air cells, the maxillary 
sinuses and the mastoid air cells appear well aerated.

IMPRESSION: Essentially unchanged left basal ganglia hemorrhagic 
vent associated with subtle surrounding vasogenic edema with 
unchanged approximately 3 mm of midline shifting.

EEG:
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG due to the presence of 
independent 
epileptiform discharges seen from both temporal lobes. No 
ongoing 
seizures were seen. The slow and somewhat disorganized 
background is 
consistent with a mild to moderate encephalopathy. Medications On Admission: Clonazepam 2mg TID

COPD, and active ___ smoker referred from her PCP's office 
for hypotension and new TWI on ECG. 

The patient reports that for the past 9 months she has felt 
nauseous every morning, with associated diaphoresis, which lasts 
for about 30 minutes. She also reports generalized fatigue which 
has also been going on for months. In the afternoon on ___ she 
took her inhaler and went into the shower. She developed burning 
right-sided chest pain and extreme fatigue which lasted for 
about one hour. Following this episode she had no other 
symptoms.  

This AM she presented to her PCP's office, Dr. ___ 
routine ___. During the visit she was noted to have a low 
blood pressure at 96/60. ECG was checked which showed inferior q 
waves, and STE V1-V6 with terminal TWI. She was referred to the 
ED for concern of STEMI. 

In the ED, initial vitals were 99.3 101 122/75 18 98%. Troponin 
was elevated to 0.23. CXR was clear. She was started on heparin 
and given ASA 325mg po x 1, and referred to cath lab. In the 
cath lab, right radial access was attempted but it was difficult 
to pass guidewire so procedure was converted to femoral approach 
on the right side. Coronories were normal without evidence of 
significant CAD. LV was noted to have apical ballooning 
concerning for takatsubos cardiomyopathy.
 
On review of symptoms she denies any worsening cough or 
shortness of breath from baseline, vomiting, abdominal pain, 
diarrhea, constipation, fevers, chills. She has had a reported 
weight loss of 5 lbs over a year with decreased appetite. She 
also reports depression. 
 
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, 
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, 
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope. Past Medical History: Hypertension

# ECG (___): Sinus rhythm with slowing of the rate as 
compared to the previous tracing of ___ there is further 
evolution of acute anterolateral and apical myocardial 
infarction with persistent ST segment elevation and deepening of 
T wave inversion as well as Q-T interval prolongation. Followup 
and clinical correlation are suggested.

# Transthoracic Echocardiogram (___): The left atrium and 
right atrium are normal in cavity size. No thrombus/mass is seen 
in the body of the left atrium. No atrial septal defect is seen 
by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is 
___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. There is 
mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with distal 
septal hypokinesis and focal apical akinesis suggested.Overall 
LV systolic funciton is preserved. No masses or thrombi are seen 
in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. 
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal 
(although the apical RV appears slightly hypokinetic). The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good 
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic 
regurgitation. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is an 
anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad. Medications On Admission: The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.

IMAGING
==========
NCHCT (___):
Acute left cerebellar intraparenchymal hemorrhage with 
surrounding edema. 
Small amount of hemorrhage layering within the lateral 
ventricles. Mild 
effacement of the fourth ventricle without hydrocephalus. 
Underlying mass is not excluded on this study and can be further 
evaluated with an MRI. 

Echo (___):
The left atrial volume index is normal. No atrial septal defect 
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and 
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending 
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are 
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace 
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears 
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is 
no mitral valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery 
systolic pressure is high normal. There is no pericardial 
effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
preserved regional and global biventricular systolic function. 
Mildly dilated ascending aorta. No definite structural cardiac 
source of embolism identified.

MRI HEAD WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST (___):
1.  Left cerebellar hemispheric hemorrhage with mild mass effect 
on the fourth ventricle, but no evidence of hydrocephalus or 
herniation,

thrombosis. 
  
3.  No large flow voids in the region of the hemorrhage to 
indicate a large underlying vascular malformation. 
  
Re-evaluation can be performed after resolution of blood 
products, which may require ___ weeks.  However, given the 
scattered foci of susceptibility representing micro-bleeds, in 
quite typical locations, hypertensive hemorrhage is the likely 
etiology of both current and previous hemorrhage.

complicated by complete heart block. History Of Present Illness: Mr. ___ is a ___ y/o M w/ HTN, GERD, treated HCV, and 
pre-diabetes, presenting ___ for chest pain, found to have 
anterolateral STEMI complicated by complete heart block. 

Patient was in his usual state of health until ___ afternoon. 
He states early in the afternoon he started to notice some 
abdominal pain after eating, around 17:00. He took a few tums, 
and then took a nap. After the nap, he noted no improvement in 
his pain, and had new, substernal chest pressure. The pain did 
not radiate, but gradually worsened, and he became more 
diaphoretic. This
prompted him to call EMS who transported him here. 

While in transport, he was found to have EKG findings concerning 
for a STEMI and 3rd degree heart block, however he remained 
normotensive, with HR ___. He was given a full dose ASA and 
fentanyl.

In the ED,  
- Initial vitals were: HR: 56 BP: 129/81 Resp: 12 O2 Sat: 100 on
RA
- Exam notable for: Patient appeared ill, was diaphoretic. Noted
to be bradycardic.    
- Labs notable for: Trop <0.1 and CK-MB 4 
- Studies notable for: EKG with complete heart block, ST
elevation in II, III, aVF, V3-V6   
- Patient was given: Atorvastatin, Ticagrelor loading dose, and
started on Heparin ggt 

Patient was immediately taken to the cath lab where the culprit 
lesion was felt to be a 100% stenosis of the proximal RCA, for 
which a DES was placed. He was also noted to have 80% stenosis 
of the mid segment of the LAD, which was not intervened upon. 
The procedural course was complicated by worsening bradycardia 
and hypotension, thought likely to be a vagal response given 
increased sensitivity in the setting of his RCA lesion. 
Following intervention, his EKG returned to normal sinus rhythm, 
with symptomatic and hemodynamic improvement. 

On arrival to the CCU, patient reiterates story as above. His 
biggest complaint is nausea, but notes his chest pain has 
improved markedly. Past Medical History: Cardiac History:

himself using his luggage as support.  He denies any associated 
symptoms including paresthesia, weakness elsewhere, visual 
symptoms or HA.  The weakness improved over ~2 hr period and he 
was able to ambulate.

Ever since, he has been having intermittent bilateral lower leg 
weakness rendering him unable to walk for ~ 2 hrs occurring 
almost weekly.  After resting/sitting, his strength would 
improve.  Last week, he went to see an ID specialist in 
___ because he was concerned that his weakness was 
related to his tic bites.  He was told that he does not have 
Lyme and that this weakness is not due to Lyme.  He was not weak 
at the time that he was seen per ID specialist.  

Then last ___, exactly 1 week ago, he was weak again hence 
went to ___ where he was seen per neurologist (Dr. 
___ who obtained LP, EMG/NCS and MRI of brain plus spine. 
Per patient, something was seen from T6 to L1 hence MRI was 
repeated with contrast for the spine but unclear if it enhanced
or not.  He was started on IV Solu-Medrol and today was his ___ 
dose - he was returning to the ED daily for the IV Solu-Medrol. 
This mid-morning, again he felt that he was dragging his feet 
then he became weak hence unable to ambulate.  He called the EMS 
and had to actually crawl on his knees to open the door for the 
EMS crew.  He was initially taken to ___ where he 
received
the 4th dose but because he remained weak without improvement, 
he was transferred here for further evaluation and care.  He 
reports that today was the ___ time that the weakness persisted 
beyond a couple of hours.  

He denies any associated symptoms including urinary/bowel 
symptoms, Lhermitte's or band-like tightness in the torso.  He 
has no visual symptoms including pain, diplopia or blurry 
vision. He also denies any HA, dyspnea, cough, N/V/D or sick 
contact.  He also denies any trauma or injury.  

He has never had symptoms like this before.  He reports that the 
pattern, intensity, frequency and duration remained stable since 
the onset about 6 weeks ago except for today's weakness which 
has persisted.

Skin: no rashes, lesions, excoriations Pertinent Results: CT ABD/PELVIS ___:
Noncontrast imaging of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrates a 
punctate 
nonobstructing calculus in the right collecting system (02:31). 
There is no left renal calculus. There is no evidence of 
ureteral or urinary bladder calculus. There is symmetric renal 
enhancement and excretion of intravenous contrast. Subcentimeter 
cortically based hypodensity in the left interpolar region 
(06:30) is too small to accurately characterize but likely 
represents renal cyst. There is no evidence of collecting system 
filling defect. There are segments of the mid to distal ureters 
are not well opacified, possibly secondary to peristalsis, 
however there is no evidence of inflammatory change or mass 
about the ureters. The adrenal glands are unremarkable. 
  
Low hepatic attenuation on noncontrast imaging is consistent 
with hepatic 
steatosis. There is no evidence of focal hepatic mass. There is 
no 
intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. There 
are numerous gallstones within the gallbladder without evidence 
of acute cholecystitis. 
  
The spleen is not enlarged. There is no pancreatic ductal 
dilatation or 
evidence of pancreatic mass. 
  
There are no dilated loops of bowel. There is no evidence of 
bowel wall 
thickening. There is no intraperitoneal free air or free fluid. 
  
There are no enlarged inguinal, iliac chain, retrocrural, or 
retroperitoneal lymph nodes. Abdominal aorta has a normal course 
and caliber with moderate atherosclerotic calcification. There 
is atherosclerotic calcification of the superior mesenteric 
artery origin. There is no suspicious osseous lesion. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
1. Tiny nonobstructing right collecting system calculus. 
2. Hepatic steatosis. 
3. 3 nodular pulmonary densities in the left basilar region 
measuring up to 8 x 8 mm. These findings may may represent areas 
of rounded atelectasis, however short-term followup with 
nonemergent CT chest is recommended.

admission.  He states that several weeks ago, he could walk a 
few city blocks without dyspnea. For the past few days, he has 
gotten out of breath while walking from his house to the car. 
This prompted him to contact ___ for an episodic visit; he saw 
Dr. ___ there today, and she referred him to the 
emergency room.  He denies chest pain, nausea/vomiting, 
diaphoresis, dizziness/lightheadedness, and palpitations.  He 
denies ___ edema or recent change in weight.

IMAGING:
EKG (___): Sinus tachycardia at a rate of 110. Left atrial 
abnormality. Inferolateral ST-T wave changes which are 
non-specific. Modest intraventricular conduction defect.  
.
EKG (___): Sinus rhythm at a rate of 86. Compared to tracing ___ wave changes are now more prominent. Cannot rule 
out underlying myocardial ischemia. 
.
CXR PA/Lat (___): IMPRESSION: 
1.  Moderate pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly with a left 
ventricular 
configuration. 
2.  Small right pleural effusion. 
3.  Anterior wedge compression deformities of several lower 
thoracic vertebral bodies. 
.
TTE (___): The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right 
atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right atrial 
pressure is ___. There is mild symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. 
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 
___ %). The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). 
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular 
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Transmitral Doppler and tissue 
velocity imaging are consistent with Grade III/IV (severe) LV 
diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. 
Right ventricular systolic function is borderline normal. The 
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) 
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild to 
moderate (___) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate (___) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern 
suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left 
atrial pressure. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. The 
end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased 
suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension. There is a 
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. 
IMPRESSION: Left ventricular severe global systolic and 
diastolic dysfunction. Mild to moderate aortic regurgitation. 
Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.   
.  
PREVIOUS 2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM:  
* Per cardiology note in ___ and ___ records: ___ echo:  EF 
35%, global hypokinesis, aortic sclerosis, mild-moderate AI, 
mild MR. ___ on cardiac meds.  
.
TTE per ___ records: Mildly dilated cardiomyopathy with a 
diastolic dimension of 6.1 cm decreasing to 4.6 end systole, 
left atrium 3.8 cm, EF 45%, patient was started on Lisinopril 
and carvedilol.
.  
ETT:  
* ___ stress echo: Per cardiology note in OMR and ___ 
records:  Patient exercised 10 minutes and 30 sec to HR of 177 
with only mild ST segment changes.  
No ischemia. Resting EF 40%, post exercise 60%. 
.
* ___ metabolic exercise stress test: Exercised for 20 
minutes and 11 secs on a ramped protocol, reaching 200 watts 
effort. His HR achieved was 153 and bp 170/90 despite 
medication.  He had only one VPC.  His peak respiratory ratio 
was 1.17 indicating a good effort.  his oxygen consumption was 
29 mL/kg/min. We anticipate that individuals with VO2 in excess 
of 20 mL/kg/min would have no symptoms related to the ___.  
This excellent response, nonetheless, represents a value, which 
is 81% predicted for an individual of his height, weight, sex, 
and age.  An echocardiogram was also performed.  This reveals a 
diastolic dimension of 6.04 cm and systolic dimension of 4.89. 
The estimated EF is approximately 45-50%, compatibile with his 
previous studies.  There is a jet of aortic reguritation, which 
appears hemodynamically unimportant.
ASSESSMENT: No evidence for ischemia (no symptoms, no ECG 
change) at a diagnostic ___ rate.
.  
CARDIAC CATH performed on ___ demonstrated: COMMENTS:      

1.  Selective coronary angiography demonstrated a co-dominant 
circulation without obstructive coronary artery disease.  LMCA, 
LCx and RCA had no angiographic evidence of flow-limiting 
stenoses.  LAD had a 10% mid-vessel plaque. 
2.  Left ventriculography demonstrated no significant mitral 
regurgitation.  There was global left ventricular hypokinesis 
with a 
calculated ejection fraction of 30%. 
3.  Resting hemodynamics demonstrated elevated filling pressures 
(mean RAP 12 mmHg, mean PCWP 14 mmHg), normal pulmonary pressure 
(mean PAP21 mmHg), and normal cardiac index (2.2 L/min/m2).  
There was no gradient across the aortic valve upon pullback of 
the catheter from the left ventricle.  
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     
  1. Mild coronary artery disease. 
  2. Severe LV dysfunction.

on doxycycline without improvement either. Her oxygen 
saturations dropped and she was tachycardic with what it is 
reproted as AFib. She was transfered to the ___ for management 
on ___.
.
She was admitted to the ICU and diuresed 5 L for possible CHF. 
She was weaned of the oxygen and had a respiratory alcalosis 
with metabolic alkalosis with a small A-a gradient, which was 
thought to be due to her COPD. Patient was also diagnosed with 
atrial fibrilation in this last hospitalization. It was made the 
decision to cotninue ASA & Plavix and not anticoagulate due to 
prior bad experiences with coumadin (unclear). She was diuresed 
and betablocked. IT was suggested to stard difoxin 50 mg BID and 
consider cardizem. BNP 1279.1

IMAGING: 
___ CXR: The lung apices are not depicted. NG tube ends in 
the gastric antrum in appropriate position. The lungs are clear, 
the cardiomediastinal silhouette and hila are normal. There is 
no pleural effusion and no pneumothorax. Partially visualized 
abdomen shows normal bowel gas pattern. 

EGD ___:
Esophagitis in the lower third of the esophagus
Small hiatal hernia
Friability and erythema in the antrum and stomach body 
compatible with gastritis
Ulcer in the pylorus
Ulcers in the duodenal bulb
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum 
Recommendations: Prilosec 40mg BID
Advance diet as tolerated. Avoid NSAIDs. Serial hcts. Active 
type and cross. GI bleeding is unlikely the cause of the 
patient's current hypotensive episodes and warrents further 
investigation for a possible infectious cause. Given the clear 
history of NSAID use, follow up egd is not required but would 
check a h pylori serology and treat if positive. Would need a 
test of cure 4 weeks post h pylori serology as well. 

.
___ CTA chest: 
1. No PE.  
2. Mild pulmonary edema. 
3. Upper lobe peribronchovascular airspace filling could be 
edema or a manifestation of more severe airspace abnormality in 
the lower lungs, mostly consolidation, partially atelectasis, 
due to aspiration, multifocal 
pneumonia, or less likely hemorrhage. In the setting of a recent 
transfusions, transfusion reaction may be contributory.    
4. Esophageal wall thickening, with diffuse infiltration of the 
mediastinal fat which may reflect inflammatory change or 
confluent lymphadenopathy, though the progression from normal 
mediastinal contours on ___ favors a rapidly evolving 
inflammatory process. There is no finding to suggest esophageal 
perforation. 
.
___ CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a 
massive increase in extent and severity of multifocal pneumonia. 
The resulting very widespread parenchymal opacities are more 
extensive on the right than on the left and show multiple air 
bronchograms. In addition, retrocardiac atelectasis has newly 
appeared, and there is a small right pleural effusion. The 
opacities are better displayed on the CTA examination, performed 
yesterday at 9:41 p.m. Moderate cardiomegaly. Medications On Admission: None

Imaging: 
=========
___ CXR  
Right middle lobe opacity obscuring the right heart border 
concerning for collapse/consolidation and marked cardiomegaly 
without overt edema.

TTE ___:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No left atrial 
mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal 
echocardiography). The right atrium is dilated. Left ventricular 
wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are 
normal (LVEF55%). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function 
is likely more depressed given the severity of mitral 
regurgitation.] The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated 
with normal free wall contractility. [Intrinsic right 
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the 
severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] The ascending aorta is 
moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly 
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild to moderate 
(___) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets 
are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. 
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The 
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to 
severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The estimated 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is mildly increased. [In the 
setting of at least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, 
the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be 
underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.] There 
is a small to moderate sized circumferential pericardial 
effusion without evidence of hemodynamic compromise.

IMPRESSION: Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. Moderate to 
severe tricuspid regurgitation. Pulmonary artery hypertension. 
Mild-moderate aortic regurgitation. Right ventricular cavity 
dilation with preserved free wall motion. Dilated ascending 
aorta.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
the severity of mitral regurgitation has increased and the 
pericardial effusion is slightly smaller. The estimated PA 
systolic pressure is now slightly lower. 

RUQ U/S ___:
1. No focal liver lesion identified.  Hepatopetal flow in the 
main portal vein which is noted to be hyperdynamic which can be 
seen in the setting of CHF. 
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions and scant trace of ascites 
in the abdomen. 
3. Small nonobstructing stone incidentally noted in the right 
kidney.

CXR ___
Borderline cardiac silhouette size, likely accentuated by AP 
technique.  
Otherwise, no definite acute intrathoracic process. 

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST ___
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process or fracture. 

TTE 
1) Possibly very small vegetation on the pulmonary valve. Image 
quality is excellent. We seldomly see the pulmonary valve this 
well depicted and therefore the nodularity could be part of a 
normal variant including Lambl's exrescene. 2) Mitral valve 
appears without vegetation. There is a very small mobile 
structure on the atrial side , the differential is likely torn 
mitral valve, beam hardening artifact, howver in this clinical 
scenario vegetation (less likely) cannot be excluded.

CHEST CT W/ CONTRAST
1. Possible minimal bronchial inflammation.  The lungs are 
otherwise clear. 
2. No evidence of rib fracture or other osseous or soft tissue 
abnormality.

STUDIES
==========================================================
___ EEG IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU 
monitoring study because of a discontinuous background 
throughout the recording, characterized by ___ Hz theta 
frequency activity with admixed delta activity and occasional 
suppressions, consistent with a moderate to several 
encephalopathy. Background reactivity is present as seen during 
bedside examination when a more continuous and higher voltage 
theta frequency activity is observed. There are no definite 
epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures. Note is made 
of an irregular cardiac rhythm throughout the recording with an 
average heart rate of 70 to 130 bpm on a single channel EKG. 

___ ECG Baseline artifact. Sinus tachycardia. Non-diagnostic Q 
waves in leads I and aVL. Borderline intraventricular conduction 
delay of the left bundle-branch block type. ST-T wave 
abnormalities. No previous tracing available for comparison. 
Clinical correlation is suggested. TRACING ___ CXR IMPRESSION: 1. Widened mediastinum may reflect low lung 
volumes and supine positioning, however mediastinal great vessel 
injury cannot be excluded. If concern exists, recommend chest 
CTA. 2. Pulmonary vascular congestion and probable mild 
pulmonary edema. 3. Bibasilar atelectasis. 4. ET tube with tip 6 
cm above carina. Enteric tube with tip projecting over stomach 
fundus. 

___ CT SPINE 1. No acute fracture or malalignment. 2. 
Heterogeneously enlarged left thyroid gland with punctate 
calcification suggestive of a goiter. Consider thyroid 
ultrasound if the patient has not had one previously if the 
patient's condition stabilizes. 3. Mild pulmonary edema. 

___ CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST IMPRESSION: 1. No acute intracranial 
hemorrhage or mass effect. 2. Subtle subcortical white matter 
hypodensity in the right frontal lobe which is nonspecific, 
potentially related to chronic small vessel infarction, but can 
also be seen with vasculitis, demyelination, or infection. This 
can be further assessed with MRI. 

___ CTA CHEST AND ABDOMEN IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of 
pulmonary embolism to the segmental level. 2. Fusiform dilation 
to 53 mm of the extrahepatic common hepatic and common bile duct 
as well as the cystic duct, compatible with type I choledochal 
cyst. Hyperdense anti-dependent material within the gallbladder 
lumen may represent sludge, however underlying mass lesion is 
also of concern. Recommend non-urgent MRCP for further 
evaluation of biliary system and gallbladder when clinically 
appropriate. 3. A 3.5 cm heterogeneous, potentially enhancing 
left renal lesion, concerning for neoplasm. Patent ipsilateral 
renal vein. This could be further evaluated at the time of Medications On Admission: The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.

IMAGING
================
___ STRESS TEST: INTERPRETATION: This ___ year old NIDDM man 
was referred to the lab for evaluation of chest discomfort 
following negative serial cardiac markers. The patient was 
infused with 0.142 mg/kg/min of dipyridamole over 4 minutes. No 
arm, neck, back or chest discomfort was reported by the patient 
throughout the study. The patient did report transient episodes 
of nausea throughout the study. There were no significant ST 
segment changes during the infusion or in recovery. The rhythm 
was sinus with rare isolated vpbs. In late recovery, there was 
an 8 beat run of a narrow complex PSVT. Appropriate hemodynamic 
response to the infusion and recovery. The dipyridamole was 
reversed with 125 mg of 
aminophylline IV. 
IMPRESSION: No anginal type symptoms or ischemic EKG changes. 
Nuclear 
report sent separately. 

CARDIAC PERFUSION PHARM
IMPRESSION:  1.  Mild fixed inferior wall defect most likely 
secondary to 
attenuation.  No additional myocardial perfusion defect.  
  
2.  Normal left ventricular ejection fraction of 64%. 

TTE ___: Conclusions  
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is 
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion 
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular 
systolic function is normal (LVEF = 65%). Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending 
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear 
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic 
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears 
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The 
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is 
no pericardial effusion. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
the findings are similar.

improved on nitro gtt and remained chest pain free after nitro 
gtt weaned. Patient had nuclear MIBI performed that showed no 
evidence of coronary artery disease. He tolerated a diet well 
after stress test. Given negative stress test, no further 
work-up or changes were made to his medical regimen. His chest 
pain was thought to be either due to pericarditis vs 
musculoskeletal pain; however, his EKG was not convincing enough 
for pericarditis to start colchicine.

(Note: patient had right sided chest tube removed that had been 
placed at outside hospital) History Of Present Illness: In summary, Mr. ___ is a ___ year old male with past medical 
history significant for COPD on home O2, HTN, paroxysmal atrial 
fibrillation, (not on coumadin; compliance issues), diastolic 
CHF, and OA who presented initially to OSH at ___ on 
___ with worse shortness of breath from baseline, poor PO 
intake. Notable leukocytosis to 22k range and concern for 
underlying PNA. Additional imaging with chest CT revealed 
loculated right pleural effusion with pleural thickening 
suggestive of an empyema as well as smaller left sided effusion. 
Zosyn was initiated on ___ and chest tube was placed at OSH 
with failure to obtain any pleural fluid. Outside hospital labs 
were significant for leukocytosis 22.2 ___: 10.7); HCT 43; 
Na: 135; Co2: 32.7; Creatinine 1.7 (prior 0.9); U tox negative.  

.
He was transferred to ___ SICU for additional thoracics 
evaluation for potential VATS/pigtail placement vs. 
decortication but thoracics team did not feel imaging or 
clinical picture suggestive of true empyema and feels this is a 
chronic effusion that does not need to be drained. SICU vitals 
on arrival to ___ on ___ were:  HR 93, BP 107/55, RR 
24 and O2 sat 97% 3L. Thoracic service had chest tube removed 
___, this morning. Per SICU team, patient's leukocytosis felt 
to be secondary to possible PNA vs. UTI given that recent urine 
studies  growing coag negative staph. Patient was started on 
Vanco/Zosyn at ___ which was continued here over past day.  
.
In addition, at OSH patient went into afib with RVR to 120s and 
was managed on a combination of digoxin and diltiazem gtt prior 
to transitioning back to oral beta blocker therapy with fair 
resolution and HR control (HRs 70-80s). 
.
Also developed ARF over last week as his creatinine on admission 
to ___ was 0.8 on ___ and now up to low 2 range. He had 
exposure to contrast for CT imaging studies and he was also 
given lasix for question of CHF exacerbation at OSH which may 
have been contributing factors. Lasix held here since admission. 

.
Lower extremity doppler done here after transfer for mild ___ 
edema and picked up a right ___ DVT with thrombus within the 
right superficial femoral vein and within the right popliteal 
vein. At time of transfer now patient has yet to be started on 
anticoagulation for DVT. 
.
Lastly, patient also complained of some vague abdominal pains 
and per reports he had question of obstruction at OSH so KUB 
performed with with nonspecific bowel gas pattern. Here in SICU 
patient has had healthy bowel sounds but mild LLQ tenderness. No 
BM since transferred at 10pm last night, no nausea, no vomiting. 
Of note, history of diverticulosis.

___ CXR:
The examination is compared to ___. In the 
interval, the 
patient has received a right-sided PICC line. The tip of the 
line projects 
over the lower SVC. There is no evidence of complications, 
notably no 
pneumothorax. 
Otherwise, the radiograph is unchanged. 

___ CXR - FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, 
the right-sided chest tube  has been removed. Minimal right 
pleural thickening, minimal left pleural effusion. No evidence 
of pneumothorax. 
.
___ CXR - FINDINGS: Small lung volumes. Borderline size of the 
cardiac silhouette, small left pleural effusion, small platelike 
right atelectasis. On the right, the patient has a chest tube. 
The sidehole of the tube is outside the pleural cavity and 
projects over the soft tissues. There is no evidence of 
pneumothorax. 
.
___ RLE Ultrasound: 
Thrombus within the right superficial femoral vein, with total 
occlusion seen in the mid portion and partial occlusion seen in 
the proximal portion. The distal portion is patent. Patent right 
common femoral vein, which contains a catheter. Small isolated 
nonocclusive thrombus within the right popliteal vein. 
Non-compressible thrombus demonstrated in at least one right 
deep calf vein. No DVT detected within the left lower extremity. 
The left peroneal veins were not assessed as the patient refused 
further evaluation. 6. 3.0 x 2.1 x 2.7 cm right groin hematoma, 
without internal flow. 
.
OUTSIDE HOSPITAL IMAGES:
___: Chest CT: MDCT of the chest was done with intravenous 
infusion of 100 cc Omnipaque 300. Sagittal and coronal 
reformatted images were obtained. There is a moderate posterior 
right pleural effusion. Suggestion of thickening and enhancement 
of the surrounding pleural surfaces. There is minimal swelling 
of the overlying soft tissue as well. There is a minimal 
posterior left pleural effusion. There is anterior pericardial 
thickening or a small loculated anterior pericardial effusion. 
Streaky pulmonary parenchymal densities bilaterally, consistent 
with subsegmental atelectasis and/or scarring. There is 
scattered atherosclerotic calcification. The heart and 
mediastinal structures are otherwise unremarkable. No 
lymphadenopathy is identified. There is no significant chest 
wall abnormality. IMPRESSION: POSTERIOR RIGHT PLEURAL EFFUSION. 
EVIDENCE FOR SURROUNDING PLEURAL THICKENING AND ENHANCEMENT

===============
CXR (___):
Right-sided PICC is seen with tip terminating in the low
SVC/cavoatrial junction. No pneumothorax.  No dense 
consolidative
opacity.  Cardiac silhouette appears within normal limits. 

EUS ___
Impression: 
EUS was performed using a linear echoendoscope at ___ MHz
frequency: The head and uncinate pancreas were imaged from the
duodenal bulb and the second / third duodenum. The body and tail
[partially] were imaged from the gastric body and fundus.
Pancreas duct: the pancreas duct measured 3 mm in maximum
diameter in the head of the pancreas and 2 mm in maximum 
diameter
in the body of the pancreas. 
Bile duct: The maximum diameter of the bile duct was 9 mm and
had biliary plastic stent in situ which limited the ampullary
exam.
The ampulla was visualized endoscopically with both the
echoendoscope as well as a duodenoscope. The depth of invasion 
of
the previously identified ampullary mass was difficult to
appreciate on ultrasound given artifact from fatty pancreas and
biliary stent. There were no appreciable lymph nodes in the
___ region.
Pancreas parenchyma: The parenchyma in the uncinate, head, body
and tail of the pancreas was homogenous, and hyperechoic
compatible with fatty pancreas.
Otherwise normal upper eus to third part of the duodenum
 
PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS:

URINE CULTURE (Final ___: 
      MIXED BACTERIAL FLORA ( >= 3 COLONY TYPES), CONSISTENT 
WITH SKIN
      AND/OR GENITAL CONTAMINATION. 

STUDIES:
=========================================
EKG (___)
Sinus rhythm. Left axis deviation. Intraventricular conduction 
delay. 
Consider anteroseptal myocardial infarction. ST-T wave 
abnormalities. No 
previous tracing available for comparison.  

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST (___)
An 8 mm hyperdensity is seen in the cerebellum on the left, 
likely 
representing an intraparenchymal hemorrhage or possibly a 
hyperdense lesion 
such as a vascular malformation which is considered less likely. 
Mild 
surrounding hypodensity is seen suggesting edema without 
significant mass 
effect.  There is no evidence of mass effect, or infarction.  
Prominent 
ventricles and sulci suggest age related involutional changes or 
atrophy.  
Periventricular white matter hypodensities are consistent with 
chronic small 
vessel ischemic disease.  The basal cisterns appear patent and 
there is 
preservation of gray-white matter differentiation.  
  
No fracture is identified.  Visualized paranasal sinuses, 
mastoid air cells, 
and middle ear cavities are clear.  The globes are intact.   
  
IMPRESSION:  Focus of hyperdensity in the cerebellum on the 
left, likely 
representing an intraparenchymal hemorrhage, less likely a 
hyperdense lesion 
such as a vascular malformation.  Recommend followup imaging to 
ensure 
expected evolution. 

CT C-SPINE (___)
1. Degenerative changes without cervical spine fracture or 
subluxation.    
2. Hyperdensity within the cerebellum is better characterized on 
dedicated head CT.   

CXR (___)
No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.   

FEMUR (___)
Displaced right intertrochanteric femoral neck fracture.  No 
dislocation.

ECHO (___)
The estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. Left 
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Overall 
left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 
45-50%) secondary to hypokinesis of the basal-distal anterior 
septum. The LV apex was not well seen (possibly hypokinetic). 
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic 
stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. 
The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no 
mitral valve prolapse. There is mild mitral regurgitation.There 
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction is new. Pulmonary 
pressures are higher. Other findings are similar.  

LOWER EXTREMITY FLUORO (___)
Images from the operating suite show placement of fixation 
device 
about the fracture of the proximal right femur.  Further 
information can be 
gathered from the operative report. 
  
KNEE XRAY (___)
There is moderate right knee joint effusion.  There are no signs 

for acute fractures or dislocations.  The knee joint spaces are 
relatively 
preserved.  On the AP view, there is some periosteal thickening 
along the 
lateral aspect of the distal femoral metaphysis.  This may be 
due to prior old 
trauma.  Alternatively, the patient has lung pathology, this may 
represent 
hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy. 

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST (___)
1.  Stable right cerebellar hemispheric hyperdense focus, with 
surrounding ring of vasogenic edema.     
These findings are concerning for underlying malignancy, 
although they may also be compatible with parenchymal contusion 
or primary (hypertensive) hemorrhage.  Enhanced MRI could be 
considered for further characterization of the lesion.     
2.  No evidence of new hemorrhage or large territorial 
infarction.   
3.  Age related atrophic changes and evidence of chronic small 
vessel ischemic disease. Medications On Admission: The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.

Major Surgical Or Invasive Procedure: 1. Left total mastectomy.
2. Left axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy. History Of Present Illness: The patient is a very pleasant, ___ female who has a 
past medical and past surgical history significant for right 
breast carcinoma and status post mastectomy.She developed a left 
breast carcinoma in ___ underwent lumpectomy followed by 
radiation therapy. In ___ developed another left breast 
carcinoma and this was excised with wide local excision under 
wide localexcision only protocol.She recently developed a new 
diagnosis of left breast invasive ductal carcinoma,grade 2, ER 
positive, HER-2/neu negative. We discussed surgical options for 
management to be mastectomy. We discussed we would perform a 
sentinel lymph node biopsy after the discussion at 
multidisciplinary tumor conference. We offered reconstructive 
options, however, the patient did not wish to pursue these. Of 
note, she is a Jehovah Witness and reports that she would not 
receive blood products even if they would be lifesaving.  
Therefore, we elected to proceed with a left
breast total mastectomy, left axillary sentinel lymph node 
biopsy, possible axillary lymph node dissection. Risks, 
benefits, and alternatives of the aforementioned surgical plan 
were discussed with the patient.  She voiced
understanding and wished to proceed.The patient signed informed 
consent for the procedure. Past Medical History: Bilateral breast cancer,HTN,DM,CAD,MI 1980s,SVT,CHF

Cardiac Catheterization
COMMENTS:      
1. Coronary angiography in this right-dominant system 
demonstrated 
three-vessel disease. The LMCA had no angiographically apparent 
disease. The LAD was occluded in its mid-portion an had a 
moderate sized 
D1 with a highly angulated and tortuous 80% stenosis. The LCx 
was 
occluded proximally. The RCA had a 40% proximal stenosis and a 
90% mid 
stenosis. 
2. Arterial conduit angiography demonstrated an atretic 
LIMA-LAD. The 
SVG-Diag and SVG-OM1 were patent. The SVG-RCA was occluded at 
its 
origin. 
3. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed mild systemic arterial 
hypertension with SBP 143mmHg and DBP 80mmHg. 
4. Successful PTCA/stenting of the mid RCA with a Promus Rx 
3.0x15 mm 
drug-eluting stent (DES) post-dilated with 3.5 mm then 4.0 mm 
balloons 
inflated at 18 atm. Final angiography revealed normal TIMI 3 
flow, no 
angiographically apparent dissection and 0% residual stenosis in 
the new 
stent. (see ___ comments) 
5. R ___ femoral artery angioseal closure device deployed 
without 
complications (see ___ comments) 
  
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease. 
2. Patent SVG-OM1, SVG-Diag. Occluded SVG-RCA. 
3. Atretic LIMA-LAD. 
4. Successful PTCA/stenting of the native mid RCA with a Promus 
Rx 
3.0x15 mm drug-eluting stent (DES) post-dilated with a 3.5 mm 
then 4.0 
mm balloon. (see ___ comments) 
5. R ___ femoral artery angioseal closure device deployed 
without 
complications (see ___ comments) 
6. Other territories of potential ischemia include retrograde 
limb of 
OM2 and DIAG1. DIAG1 size and anatomy suboptimal for PCI, but if 
ongoing 
angina would onsider PCI of OM2 retrograde limb stenosis by 
going 
through SVG. 
7. ASA indefinitely; plavix (clopidogrel) for a minimal of 12 
months.

diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are 
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but 
aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral valve leaflets are 
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild 
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary 
artery systolic pressure is high normal. There is no pericardial 
effusion. 
.
IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved 
global and regional biventricular systolic function. Mild mitral 
regurgitation with normal valve morphology. No pericardial

on coumadin, who is quite independent, living with his wife and 
was in a good state of health until mid last year. At that time 
his wife reports that he began having periods of disorganized 
speech and gait instability. He did not have a fall until 3 
months ago when he broke several ribs on his coffee table. He 
did not have any head trauma and was not scanned at an OSH. His 
garbled speech and unsteadiness have waxed and waned over the 
past 6 months and his wife reports that they are much improved 
when he takes his diuretics. Over this period he has lost ~20 
lbs. 
Last night he was sorting papers at the dining room table when 
he fell from standing because of the dizziness. He reports no 
LOC, no head trauma and was able to stand back up and continue 
his work. His wife placed him on the couch, but he got back up 
and fell in the bathroom - again he denies any LOC or head 
trauma, blaming his instability and ___ weakness. He had no 
tongue biting or loss of bowel/bladder continence. He went to 
bed last night, but the morning of presentation his wife was 
concerned about his falls and brought him to the ED. He does 
have a diagnosis of DM II from just over a month ago and has 
started oral hypoglycemics for which he reports having low ___ at 
home. He was seen by an outside neurologist the week prior who 
had ordered a CT head to be completed the following week. In the

Conclusions  
Pre-bypass:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left 
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There 
is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with EF 
of 45%. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are 
normal. The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta 
are normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque. The 
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are 
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal 
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic 
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with 
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no pericardial effusion. 

Post-bypass:
Lev 55%, EV structure and function normal, no new valvular 
abnormalities noted, aorta intact post decannulation   

___: PA/LAT CXR
IMPRESSION:  As compared to ___ chest radiograph, 
cardiac silhouette appears slightly larger, raising the 
possibility of a postoperative pericardial effusion in this 
patient status post recent coronary bypass surgery.  Tiny left 
apical pneumothorax is unchanged.  Bibasilar atelectasis has 
improved, and small bilateral pleural effusions are a persistent 
finding.

======================
Ms. ___ is a ___ y/o F with history of recurrent c. diff 
infection who initially presented with hypotension, fever, and 
melena, severe sepsis ___ UTI c/b report of melena concerning 
for GI bleed. On IV meropenem for ESBL klebsiella UTI w/ planned 
___GD was negative. Studies c/w ACD. ___ improved 
with IVF. Traumatic groin wounds likely secondary to diaper at 
rehab, so patient had foley while admitted. Patient began to 
have copious diarrhea, was c. diff positive with plan to 
continue PO vancomycin for one week after discontinuing 
meropenem.

ACTIVE ISSUES
===============
# Septic shock due to ESBL UTI - Evidenced by temperature at her 
nursing home, hypotension in the setting of known infectious 
source (UTI with ESBL). Empirically started on ciprofloxacin 
over the weekend which was transitioned to ertapenem upon 
culture data showing ESBL. She was transitioned to meropenem 
during her hospitalization and a PICC line was inserted.  She 
was planned for a treatment course  for a complicated UTI, for 
10 days (___). 

# C. diff diarrhea: prior to discharge patient developed watery 
diarrhea and was noted to be c. diff positive. She was started 
on PO vancomycin on ___ days after 
finishing IV meropenem (last day ___.

# Acute Blood Loss Anemia/Anemia of chronic disease - Given 
recent hemoglobin drop in the setting of melena, Ms. ___ 
was thought to have had an acute GI bleed, however, melanotic 
stools were not present this hospitalization.  She received 2 U 
PRBC and was evaluated by GI in the MICU however scoping was 
deferred until her underlying infection was under more control.  
She was transferred to the floor on ___ and underwent EGD on 
___ which was unremarkable.  Her H/H was stable on transfer to 
the floor and throughout the rest of her hospitalization.  The 
haptoglobin was elevated making hemolysis less likely and the 
TIBC was low suggesting against pure iron deficiency anemia, 
however Iron studies can be difficult to interpret post 
transfusion.  On review of records her baseline HGB is around 
___, and given her chronic infections this likely represents 
anemia of chronic disease.

# Acute renal failre on CKD stage 3 - Creatinine on admission 
2.0 with acute rise since last hospitalization (1.4 at 
discharge). Likely related to pre-renal state given sepsis and 
dehydration. Other etiologies include medication induced injury, 
ATN from hypotension, progression of underlying CKD. Improved 
with fluid resuscitation. On discharge her Cr was 1.5.

#Eosinophilia:  Eos 5% in the setting of acute illness, the 
reason for the eosinophilia is not entirely clear, however she 
had a history of eosinophillia during a previous hospitalization 
in ___ which resolved.  Her strongyloides ab at that time was 
negative. Unless suspicion for parasitic infection or atopic 
disease no further work up is indicated.

CHRONIC ISSUES
===============
# bipolar d/o - Stable, continued on home risperidone, depakote, 
and clonazepam.   

# osteoarthritis - Continued on home tramadol.

2:1 atrioventricular conduction block was present during this 
study. The left atrial volume index is severely increased. There 
is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left 
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe global 
left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20 %). The right 
ventricular free wall thickness is normal. Right ventricular 
chamber size is normal with depressed free wall contractility. 
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic 
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern 
suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left 
atrial pressure. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

DIAGNOSTICS AND IMAGING
RUQ w/ Doppler ___: 
IMPRESSION:  
Cirrhotic appearing liver with large ascites and splenomegaly.  
No suspicious masses.  Patent hepatic vasculature. 
Cholelithiasis. 

Renal US ___:
IMPRESSION:  
1.  No evidence of hydronephrosis.   
2.  Cirrhosis with large amount of intra-abdominal ascites. 

CXR ___:
IMPRESSION:  
In comparison with the study of ___, there are again low 
lung volumes that accentuate the transverse diameter of the 
heart.  Continued increased opacification at the left base, 
consistent with pleural effusion and compressive basilar 
atelectasis.  Mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels could 
reflect some elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  The ___ 
tube appears unchanged

CT A/P ___. 24 cm right retroperitoneal hematoma secondary to a right 
common femoral artery pseudoaneurysm measuring 2.2 cm with a 
neck of 0.2 cm and another component of the pseudoaneurysm just 
superiorly measuring 3 cm. 
2. Cirrhosis, ascites and splenomegaly. 
3. Cholelithiasis. 
4. Moderate right pleural effusion and bibasilar atelectasis. 

___ Arteriogram
1. Punctate foci of active extravasation from the right L3 and 
L4 lumbar 
arteries, treated with Gelfoam and coil embolization, with good 
angiographic result. 
2. The right lateral circumflex artery was in proximity to the 
known area of bleeding, and was Gel-Foam and coil embolized, 
with good angiographic result. 
3. The previously identified right common femoral artery 
pseudoaneurysm 
remains thrombosed, with a tiny area (2-3 mm) of residual 
pseudoaneurysm, too small to treat.  This will likely thrombose 
on its own. 
4. A small 4 mm pseudoaneurysm identified arising from the left 
SFA on left CFA angiography at the site of the arterial pressure 
line entry was too small to treat, and appeared thrombosed with 
ultrasound at the conclusion of the case. 

___ CT A/P
IMPRESSION:  
  
1.  Stable size of large right retroperitoneal hematoma status 
post coil 
embolization of right lumbar arteries and right lateral 
circumflex artery.  No evidence of active extravasation. 
2.  Cirrhosis with sequelae of portal hypertension including 
splenomegaly, 
ascites and perigastric varices. 
3.  No drainable fluid collection identified.  No evidence of 
bowel ischemia. 
4.  Tiny 6 mm pseudoaneurysm arising from the left superficial 
femoral artery just distal to its origin.  The pseudoaneurysm is 
superior to the site of active extravasation seen on ___. 

___ CT Chest
IMPRESSION:  
1.  Small bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent 
consolidation, which 
appears to be predominantly atelectasis.  A component of 
infection may also be present. 
2.  CT abdomen/pelvis reported separately. 

___ CT Head
1. Severely motion limited examination demonstrating no acute 
large 
intracranial abnormality. 
2. Fluid in the posterior nasopharynx and mastoid air cells 
bilaterally.

___ CT A/P
IMPRESSION: 
1. Large right retroperitoneal hematoma is similar in appearance 
to prior 
examination given redistribution.  No evidence of active bleed. 
2. No findings to suggest infection in the abdomen or pelvis. 

___ CT Chest
IMPRESSION:  
No evidence of active intrathoracic infection or malignancy. 
Small bilateral effusions with persistent left left lower lobe 
collapse and right basal atelectasis with increasing 
endobronchial secretions in the lower lobes. Medications On Admission: The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.

IMAGING:
Head CT ___ HEAD CT: There is right 
parietooccipital scalp hematoma, without underlying acute 
fracture seen. Two prior burr holes are noted ___ the right 
parietal skull. Diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage ___ the right 
cerebral hemisphere and also foci ___ the left frontal lobe 
appear similar to that seen on outside hospital CT performed six 
hours prior. Several foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage along the 
left superior convexity are newly apparent. There are also 
bilateral small predominantly frontal subdural hematomas, which 
measures up to 4 mm on the left, which appear unchanged. Small 
focus of hemorrhagic contusion along the inferior right frontal 
lobe is unchanged. There is new intraventricular extension of 
hemorrhage layering bilaterally ___ the occipital horns. 
High-density is also noted within the interpeduncular fossa. 
Size of the ventricles is unchanged, without evidence of 
hydrocephalus. No shift of normally midline structures or 
effacement of the basal cisterns is seen. No evidence for large 
vascular territorial infarction is seen. The ventricles and 
sulci appear normal ___ size and configuration for the patient's 
age. Vascular calcifications are noted along the carotid siphons 
and vertebral 
arteries. The patient has had prior bilateral lens replacement. 
Mild mucosal thickening is noted within anterior ethmoid air 
cells and the left maxillary sinus, with small mucus retention 
cysts along the floor of the left maxillary sinus. The mastoid 
air cells are normally aerated. 
IMPRESSION: Acute subarachnoid, subdural, and intraparenchymal 
hemorrhages as described above. Compared to six hours prior, 
couple of new foci of 
subarachnoid hemorrhage along the left superior complexity are 
newly apparent, as well as intraventricular extension of 
hemorrhage. No shift of normally midline structures, effacement 
of the basal cisterns, or hydrocephalus. 

Head CT ___:
FINDINGS: No significant interval change. There is a 
subarachnoid hemorrhage located ___ the right cerebral hemisphere 
and left frontal lobe. Overall, the appearance is similar to 
prior study. There is a tiny amount of blood layering along the 
falx and tentorium as well as dependently within the bilateral 
lateral ventricles, also subtle. There is a right frontal 
subdural hematoma, which appears similar compared to prior 
study. Previously noted left frontal subdural hematoma is 
slightly less prominent. There is an area of contusion ___ the 
right inferior frontal lobe with similar appearance compared to 
prior study, with unchanged surrounding edema. There is no 
evidence of new hemorrhage. There is no significant shift of 
midline structures. The ventricles and sulci are prominent, 
which could be due to age-related atrophy and appears similar 
compared to prior study. There are bilateral carotids siphons 
and vertebral artery calcifications. The patient is status post 
two burr holes on the right calvarium. Visualized portion of 
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are within normal 
limits. 
IMPRESSION: Overall unchanged appearance of subarachnoid, 
intraparenchymal, and intraventricular hemorrhage allowing for 
some redistribution. No shift of midline structures. 

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST Study Date of ___

type 2, hypertension, atrial fibrillation on eliquis, mild
cognitive decline (presumed), who presents as
hospital-to-hospital transfer for evaluation of abnormal finding
on head CT. History obtained by patient and patient's daughter
and niece at bedside. 

Per patient (who digresses quite a bit on conversation), she was
feeling well up until about 4 days ago when she became nauseous
and started to vomit. She thought she had a stomach bug because
she just was not feeling well at all and didn't even good enough
to get up out of bed to dust the TV. The patient cannot say if
her symptoms suddenly came on. She does endorse some double
vision when she does not wear her glasses that "comes and goes"
and "gets better" after she puts her glasses on. Additional
details regarding nausea and vomiting limited as patient
continues to digress in conversations.

Her daughter notes that she last saw her mother 5 days ago for
___. She had picked her mother up to celebrate
Thanksgiving with the family down at the ___. During that week,
while she was watching her mother throughout the day she noticed
that her mother's word-finding difficulty was worse and that her
appetite was significantly decreased. She also noted that her
mother's gait was worse, wobbling to both the left and the right
despite use of a cane. The daughter does note that this decline
has been ongoing for the past several months, however despite
this decline the patient is completely independent at home and
continues to work 15 hrs a week at Stop and Shop and continues 
to
drive at night. When asked to elaborate on the decline over the
last few months, the daughter notes a slow decline in the
patient's word-finding difficulty, disorientation to day and
month sometimes. She also notes a ___ weight loss over the
past ___ months. 

ROS challenging as patient continues to digress without clarity
of specific details regarding timing/intensity of symptoms 
noted.
She does endorse transient double vision that resolves with
wearing glasses, nausea that has subsided, and denies vertigo.
She had a frontal throbbing headache but that has since 
resolved.
She thinks her gait is steady with her cane.

___ based on her last period.  Blood type is O
positive, antibody negative, hepatitis negative, rubella
immune.  Hematocrit, baseline, was 37.5.  One significant
finding on ___ an ultrasound showed a normal
intrauterine pregnancy with an anterior fibroid approximately
4 x 4 cm.

PAST OB HISTORY:  Significant for a low segment transverse
cesarean section in ___ for a nonreassuring tracing.  She
was a gestational diabetic A2.

GYN HISTORY:  Significant for the fibroid, history of
abnormal Pap status post cryo over ___ years ago. Past Medical History: Significant for migraine.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Only significant for the C-section.

HOME MEDICATIONS:
1. Tylenol.
2. Zofran.
3. Colace.
4. MiraLAX. Social History: She lives with her daughter.  She is not in
a relationship.  She broke up with the father of the baby.
She feels safe at home.  No report of domestic violence.  She
is an ___ at ___.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  VITAL SIGNS:  Her blood pressure is
135/86, respiratory rate 18, heart rate 79, and the
temperature was 98.0.  GENERAL:  The patient was crying,
appears uncomfortable, moaning, but no acute distress.  After
IV medications, patient had significant relief and appeared
comfortable.  ABDOMEN:  Obese.  Large diffuse left-sided
tenderness, worse in the left mid abdominal region.  No
rebound or guarding.  She had mild back tenderness.  No
significant CVA tenderness bilaterally.  PELVIC:  On sterile
speculum examination, she had normal vaginal mucosa, normal-
appearing cervix, no bleeding.  On sterile vaginal exam, she
had moderate left-sided adnexal tenderness, only with
abdominal pressure.  No right adnexal tenderness.  No fundal
tenderness.  No cervical motion tenderness.  EXTREMITIES:
Nontender.

LABORATORY DATA:  Her labs which were significant, her white
count was 20, her hemoglobin and hematocrit was 10.6 and
32.4, platelet count of 400.  She had 90% neutrophils, no
bands.

Her UA was significant with small amount of blood, negative
nitrites, 30 of protein, large leukocytes.  Her WBC count
greater than 182, a few bacteria, and only 4 epithelials.  A
urine culture was sent.

Her abdominal ultrasound at the bedside normal intrauterine
pregnancy, positive fetal movement.

On ultrasound when the patient was admitted in the region of
the patient's abdominal discomfort showed dilated loops of
bowel on ultrasound without evidence of peristalsis which
raises the question of a possible ileus.  The patient was
also noted to have gallstones but no right upper quadrant
pain.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  So this is a patient at 12 weeks and 5
days gestation with left-sided abdominal pain, nausea, and
vomiting of unclear etiology.  Urinalysis was suggestive of a
urinary tract infection with no significant flank tenderness.
Significant for showing pyelonephritis and our concern for
constipation and ileus, the plan was to admit the patient for
observation, empiric treatment for urinary tract infection,
and constipation, to be placed n.p.o. until bowels started
moving.  The patient was passing gas appropriately.  The
patient also had an elevated glucose level on her chemistry
when she was being admitted of 185.  The patient does have a
history of gestational diabetes in her prior pregnancy, so
the plan for patient to also follow up with ___ during
this pregnancy.  We will monitor fingersticks during the in-
house stay and discussed with the patient placing her on a
diabetic diet.  The patient was admitted, had 2 days of IV
antibiotics, had repeat labs drawn.  The patient was also
placed on an aggressive bowel regimen with IV fluids, n.p.o.
with ice chips, and the attempt was to hold narcotics.  Day 1
on admission, the white blood cell count dropped to 17.9 with
89% neutrophils.  Urine culture was still pending.  We had
minimal improvement as per patient.  She had some more
comfort.  The patient was also seen by Nutrition in-house for
teaching.  Patient remained afebrile during her stay at the
hospital, had some nausea but was improving.  Urine culture
grew out greater than 100,000 E coli.  Sensitivities were
pending.  Patient was transitioned over to p.o. antibiotics,
Keflex, and the plan was for patient to go home on p.o.
Keflex and to follow up with ___ and GI for her history of
constipation.  By the time the patient was discharged, she
was tolerating p.o. antibiotics and oral intake, passing
flatus, and having normal bowel movements.

day, there is no significant interval change. The previously 
described ill-defined opacities are not as apparent on today's 
study. 
 
CXR s/p PPM: FINDINGS: In comparison with study of ___, there 
has been placement of a pacemaker device with single lead 
extending to the region of the apex of the right ventricle. 
Substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists with 
relatively normal pulmonary vessels, raising the possibility of 
cardiomyopathy or pericardial effusion. 

Echo: The left atrium is moderately dilated. No left atrial 
mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal 
echocardiography). The right atrium is moderately dilated. The 
estimated right atrial pressure is ___. Left ventricular 
wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic 
function are normal (LVEF >55%). The right ventricular cavity is 
dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The ascending 
aorta is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not 
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve 
prolapse. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Right ventricular cavity dilation with free wall 
hypokinesis. Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Normal left 
ventricular cavity size with preserved global and regional 
systolic function.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: 
Based on ___ AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the 
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical 
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on 
clinical and echocardiographic data.

IMAGING
CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast ___ 
Large amount of pelvic ascites is present. The rectum and 
sigmoid colon appear grossly unremarkable. The bladder is also 
unremarkable. 
Bone windows demonstrate no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions. 

IMPRESSION: 
1. Advanced infiltrate of hepatocellular carcinoma with probable 
occlusion of the right portal vein as described on previous CT. 
New interval increase in large volume ascites likely indicates 
disease progression. 
2. Diffuse hyperenhancement of the small and large bowel likely 
related to 
occlusion of the portal system. Lack of progression of oral 
contrast material beyond the stomach despite two-hour interval 
of administration. There is no definite obstruction as there are 
no dilated loops of small bowel or air-fluid levels. NG tube 
terminates within the stomach. 
3. No definite free intraperitoneal air. 
.
CXR ___ 
FINDINGS: The heart is normal in size. The mediastinal and hilar 
contours 
are normal. There is no subdiaphragmatic free air. The lungs are 
clear. The visualized osseous structures appear within normal 
limits. 
IMPRESSION: No radiographic evidence of free air. 
.
KUB ___
No gross evidence of change. Contrast now in the colon thus no 
obstruction. No supine evidence of free air. 
.
EGD ___
Findings: 
Esophagus: Protruding Lesions 4 cords of grade II varices were 
seen in the lower third of the esophagus. The varices were not 
bleeding. 4 bands were successfully placed.  
Stomach:  Mucosa: Diffuse continuous erythema, congestion and 
mosaic appearance of the mucosa with no bleeding were noted in 
the whole stomach. These findings are compatible with mild 
portal hypertensive gastropathy. Small ammout of dark blood was 
seen in the stomach.   
Duodenum:  Mucosa: Normal mucosa was noted.  
*Impression*: Varices at the lower third of the esophagus 
(ligation)
Erythema, congestion and mosaic appearance in the whole stomach 
compatible with mild portal hypertensive gastropathy
-Normal mucosa in the duodenum
-Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum 
.
------------------
CT Torso ___
CT Chest
Thyroid and thoracic inlet appear unremarkable. Paraseptal blebs 
are present. No discrete metastases of note. 
. 
CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. 
There is a massive confluent infiltrative hepatocellular 
carcinoma . This has substantially increased in size, and now 
involves the entire liver. Ascites is now present. This is a new 
finding. Focal areas of Ethiodol uptake are identified within 
the more central necrotic parts of this tumor. Aneurysmal 
dilatation of the left portal vein. Hepatic right portal vein 
appears occluded. The hepatic veins appear patent, although 
parts of the middle hepatic vein are grossly attenuated. 
Enlargement and recruitment of the hepatic artery is seen. There 
is infiltration into the anterior omentum, which may represent 
tumor spread. No definite metastatic disease is seen. 
. 
CT PELVIS  
Ascites as before. Prostate is normal. Bladder appears normal. 
Large and small bowel appear grossly unremarkable. 
. 
CT BONES AND SOFT TISSUES: 
No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesion. 
There are degenerative changes, possibly represent old trauma, 
along the right inferior pubic ramus.   
CONCLUSION: 
Massive disease progression with right portal vein and possibly 
middle hepatic veins are occluded. No definitive extra-hepatic 
spread.

internal carotid occlusion and right posterior circulation 
infarction. Major Surgical Or Invasive Procedure: None Past Medical History: who presents after discovery of a right PCA
territory infarct on an MRI that was performed the day of
presentation.

The history is obtained from the patient.
He reports that for the past 14 months, he has had "ocular
migraines".  He describes these as visual changes, mostly
involving the right eye (although he did not do his 
cover-uncover
test) where he would have intermittent loss of vision in the
right eye, or part of his vision missing in his  left visual
field, including either the top medial portion of his vision, 
the
lower medial portion of his vision, or the entire nasal visual
field.  He was evaluated by ophthalmology intermittently, who 
did
not discover any abnormal findings with the eye, and gave him 
the
diagnosis of ocular migraines.  On ___, he developed

A different sort of headache, which involved a dull holoacranial
pressure-like sensation, which was very severe.  This was
associated with nausea and vomiting, as well as lightheadedness,
photophobia.  He initially presented to an outside hospital, and
was again given the diagnosis of migraines.  He underwent a CT 
at
the outside hospital, which was reportedly normal.  Given the 
new
onset of migraines, he was referred to neurology as an
outpatient.  He saw an outpatient neurologist on ___,
who reportedly did not find any abnormal findings on neurologic
exam, and ordered an MRI to evaluate for structural causes of
headache.  For multiple reasons, this MRI was not done until
___, which was done with an MRA with and without contrast. 

This discovered a totally occluded right ICA as well as a cut 
off
in the right proximal PCA, with a subacute appearing infarct in
the right PCA territory.  The patient was advised to immediately
come to ___ for further workup.

Regarding his risk factors, the patient reports that he has had
multiple  traumas, from old ___'s and football injuries.  
However
the last ones that he had were about ___ years ago.  None of
these events were associated with the development of unilateral
neurologic symptoms.  Of note, he developed palpitations in 
___,
and reportedly underwent a workup including a Holter monitor and
transthoracic echo, revealing PVCs but no evidence of atrial
fibrillation or other tachyarrhythmias.  He is not sure if he 
has
an ASD or PFO.  He does admit to snoring,  and his wife at
bedside attests to frequent episodes of apnea.  He does not have
any daytime somnolence.  He has not had a sleep study.  No
current constitutional symptoms.

recent attempt to detox from ETOH at ___.  was witnessed to 
be altered and have a ___ second episode of apnea while at 
___.  Had been starting Librium there.  In ED given 
flumazenil x2, noted to be significantly altered and minimally 
responsive.  Briefly admitted to the MICU where he was put on 
BiPAP and put on phenobarbital pathway.  Respiratory failure 
resolved with BiPAP + O2 at night to avoid desaturations.  He 
was medically detoxed from alcohol on the phenobarb taper.  He 
was A&O x3 at discharge.

MICU COURSE
-----------
#Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Most likely multifactorial, 
depressed respiratory drive in the setting of 
benzodiazepine/potential other drug overdose, pulmonary edema 
secondary to possible heart failure, sleep apnea in the setting 
of no CPAP, and possible obstructive lung disease. Patient was 
treated with 80 mg IV Lasix with appropriate urine output. He 
was intermittently put on BiPAP with close monitoring of his 
respiratory status. 

#Acute encephalopathy: Most likely multifactorial due to 
hypercarbia, benzodiazepine/other toxic ingestion. Urine and 
serum tox screens were positive for benzodiazepines on 
admission, in the setting of Librium intake at his ___ 
facility.

#EtOH abuse: Treated with phenobarbital load and taper, with 
high dose IV thiamine, folate, and multivitamin.

#Diabetes: Novolog was restarted once his mental status improved 
and he was tolerating po intake.

IMAGING STUDIES: 

ECHO ___
Suboptimal image quality. The left atrium is normal in size. 
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global 
systolic function are normal (LVEF = 65%). Due to suboptimal 
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be 
fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The 
number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic 
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild aortic 
valve stenosis (valve area = 1.9 cm2). Mild (1+) aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen (may be 
underestimated). The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is 
seen (may be underestimated). There is borderline pulmonary 
artery systolic hypertension. [In the setting of at least 
moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to 
a very high right atrial pressure.] There is no pericardial 
effusion.  

___ CT CHEST 
 
Although there are moderate bilateral pleural effusions, severe 
coronary 
calcification and sufficient aortic valvular calcification to 
produce aortic stenosis, the extremely asymmetric and non 
dependent distribution of the severe interstitial and alveolar 
abnormality, favoring the right lung and 
scattered elsewhere in the periphery of the left lung means that 
cardiogenic pulmonary edema is not a sufficient explanation for 
the severe lung findings although it may be contributory. 
  
Differential diagnosis of the pulmonary abnormality includes 
severe viral 
infection, viral infection leading to diffuse alveolar damage, 
and acute 
interstitial pneumonia.  The large region of sparing in the left 
lower lobe argues against pneumocystis pneumonia, but certainly 
does not exclude that 
diagnosis. 
Severe generalized atherosclerotic calcification involves the 
head and neck vessels, particular the carotid arteries in 
addition to the coronaries. 

___ CT CHEST:  
1.  Slight interval improvement in persistent extensive 
pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities, worst in the right upper 
lobe.  Differential diagnosis includes, as before, severe viral 
infection and acute interstitial pneumonia.  
Chronic aspiration is possible as well. 
2.  Posterior defect in the trachea is not currently seen and 
likely 
represented artifact on prior CT.  Confirmation of 
tracheoesophageal fistula would require barium swallow study 
under fluoroscopy.

receiving rituximab (q6 months), plaquenil, and prednisone 
(history of multiple previous DMARDs), recent diagnosis of 
Enterococcal bacteremia and osteomyelitis at an OSH, MDS, afib, 
and CHF currently admitted to ___ with dyspnea and hypoxia 
found to have substantial bilateral interstitial and alveolar 
disease on CT imaging. The patient has remained profoundly 
hypoxemic despite broad abx coverage and diuresis, and he was 
found to have an elevated B-glucan and LDH, as well as NP swab 
positive for parainfluenza.

#Goals of care:  ___ wife was called on ___ by Dr. ___ 
___ to discuss worsening respiratory status despite maximum 
intervention within the current goals of care with worsening 
metabolic state and agitation. Discussed that he has had ongoing 
treatment for pneumonia (PCP and viral pneumonia) and diuresis 
without improvement in his oxygenation and noted to have 
worsening O2 needs. Relayed that our hope has been to get him 
through his acute illness but that he is currently showing signs 
of deterioration in terms of his pulmonary function, mental 
status and electrolytes concerning for worsening disease 
process. Dr. ___ discussed with ___ family that we could 
continue to move forward with current care but the concern is 
that he is worsening and at risk of death. Also noted that he is 
more uncomfortable with rising oxygen needs. ___ wife 
spoke to her son and called back to confirm they would like to 
transition to comfort focused care. On ___, Dr. ___ met with 
the ___ wife and two sons at the ___ bedside to 
confirm their understanding of the severity of his illness and 
his wished for ongoing care. Patient unable to participate in 
discussion due to delirium. ___ wife and sons noted that 
they understood that he was worsening and "dying" and that they 
wanted to transition to comfort for the patient, per his prior 
wishes. We discussed the steps for this transition including 
medications to make his breathing more comfortable, help with 
agitation and delirium. The family was offered hospice services 
to help with coping but declined. All questions were answered. 
After this, his oxygen was removed and IV morphine drip was 
initiated for comfort.  

# Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure 
# Viral/HCAP/Multilobar/Interstitial Pneumonia 
Presented with persistent hypoxemia. CXR and CT scan suggested 
multifocal pneumonia most consistent with an atypical viral or 
bacterial etiology. CT showing diffuse asymmetric parenchymal 
changes c/w viral vs. interstitial pneumonia vs. alveolar 
hemorrhage with underlying volume overload possibly contributing 
as well. Because he was DNR/DNI, bronch was not able to pursued 
b/c would have compromised his already tenuous respiratory 
status. Initially started on vanc/zosyn for HCAP, steroids and 
Bactrim for possible PCP ___ (given recent steroid use), 
and resp viral panel came back positive for H flu. He did not 
improve on this regimen and still had substantial oxygen 
requirement. Duiresis was attempted without improvement in 
oxygenation. During his course developed worsening acidosis, 
hyponatremia, and altered mental status. He was unable to 
tolerate POs due to altered mental status, and it was confirmed 
with family that NGT/PEG were not in goals of care. In this 
setting he was transitioned to comfort care. 

On ___, MD called to bedside by RN at 00:10 for declining 
O2 saturations and bradycardia. Patient appeared comfortable 
taking shallow, intermittent respirations on morphine drip. 
Respiratory rate decreased and then ceased. Intermittent ectopy 
noted on telemetry then ceased and pulses were lost. Auscultated 
for breath sounds and cardiac sounds x1 minute with no activity. 
Pupillary response absent. No withdrawal to painful stimuli.

ECHO WITH AGITATED SALINE

The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect or 
patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline 
contrast with maneuvers. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are 
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional 
left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular 
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve 
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral regurgitation 
is seen (within normal limits). The left ventricular inflow 
pattern suggests impaired relaxation. There is no pericardial 
effusion. There is an anterior space which most likely 
represents a prominent fat pad.

not currently on treatment, who presented to an OSH on ___ 
with abdominal cramping and vomiting. He stated that he felt 
like his "stomach cramped up" on ___. He described pain in 
his lower abdomen, in the midline. He described the pain as 
intense, coming in waves, and associated w/ diaphoresis. He 
denies any distension or bloating. He reported a normal BM on 
the morning of admission. He ended up presenting to the ER on 
___ because he could not tolerate the pain. He was nauseated at 
the time, but denied any vomiting. In the ER, his VS were T 
99.8, BP 137/92, HR 63, RR 18. He was given morphine 4mg IV x2, 
phenergan 12.5mg IV x1 and zofran 4mg IV x1. He was also 
hydrated with NS. He underwent a CT with PO contrast and then, 
after the scan, began vomiting. He had an NGT placed which 
immediately drained 400cc of baracat and bile. His CT scan 
showed a mass in the LLQ which was likely the cause of his 
obstruction. He was admitted for further management of his SBO 
and surgical consultation. Since admission, his NGT has been 
averaging 200-300cc/shift. He was on morphine IV, zofran IV, and 
heparin SC for medications. He was receiving IVF (NS) at 75/hr. 
On ___, his exam was notable for a soft abdomen. He was 
noted to feel better (pain subsided at about 2am) and had passed 
a small amount of flatus in the AM. His KUB showed resolving 
SBO. His physicians spoke to his oncologist here and the 
decision was made to transfer him here for further work-up and 
evaluation of his SBO. On transfer here, he continues to drain 
brownish fluid from his NGT. He is pain free and is no longer 
nauseated. His NGT is "irritating" to his throat, but he is 
otherwise asymptomatic currently. He continues to have flatus,

IMAGING:
___ CTA ABD W&W/O C & RECON:
At the lung bases, there is a 1.4 cm cystic lesion at the left 
lung base.  Lungs are clear without consolidation or pleural 
effusion. The heart size is normal without pericardial effusion. 

  
In the abdomen, a hypoattenuating pancreatic head mass measures 
up to 2.1x 
1.5 cm (3:48). The mass appears confined to the parenchyma of 
the pancreatic head. It results in marked intra- and 
extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation, with the extrahepatic 
CBD measuring up to 11 mm, similar to the prior MRCP. The 
pancreatic head mass is close to but does not appear to abut the 
adjacent inferior vena cava, and the intervening fat plane 
appears preserved. No other vessels pass in close proximity to 
the pancreatic head mass. In particular, the celiac and superior 
mesenteric arterial vessels, as well as the portal vein, SMV and 
splenic vein, are not in contact with the mass. Hepatic arterial 
supply is conventional. Incidentally noted are two right renal 
arteries. There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric 
lymphadenopathy by size criteria. A tiny lymph node adjacent to 
the pancreatic head lesion measures approximately 3 mm. 
Incidentally noted is a retroaortic left renal vein. 
  
There is mild pancreatic ductal prominence, without overt 
dilatation, with the duct measuring up to 3 mm. Pancreatic 
parenchyma of the body and tail is within normal limits, without 
evidence of atrophy. 
  
The patient is post-cholecystectomy. Hepatic parenchyma enhances 
normally, without worrisome focal lesion. The spleen, right 
adrenal gland, and duodenum are unremarkable. Kidneys enhance 
and excrete contrast symmetrically without hydronephrosis, 
stones or renal masses. The right kidney is somewhat displaced 
inferiorly, a normal variant. 
  
The left adrenal gland is nodular and slightly enlarged, with 
nodular foci measuring up to 15 mm. Attenuation characteristics 
are consistent with adenoma. 
  
The abdominal aorta is normal in caliber, with trace 
atherosclerotic calcification. There is no free air or free 
fluid in the abdomen. Visualized loops of large and small bowel 
are unremarkable. 
  
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There is no fracture or worrisome bony 
lesion. Soft tissues are unremarkable.

___ : Cytology Report COMMON BILE DUCT BRUSHINGS: 
   
SPECIMEN DESCRIPTION: Received brush in Cytolyt. 
  Prepared 1 ThinPrep slide. 
  
CLINICAL DATA: A level 4 consult was performed. Painless 
jaundice. 
  Mass in head of pancreas on CT with dilated ducts. 
  
DIAGNOSIS: Common bile duct brushing: 
    
  POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS 
  consistent with adenocarcinoma. 

DIAGNOSED BY: 
 ___, CT(ASCP) 
___, M.D. 
.
___ Pre-Op CXR:
FINDINGS: Lungs are clear. No pneumonia. No pleural effusion or 
pneumothorax. Hilar, mediastinal, and cardiac silhouettes are 
within normal limits. 
  
IMPRESSION: No pneumonia.
.
___ ERCP:
Impression: Normal major papilla.  Cannulation of the biliary 
duct was successful and deep with a sphincterotome after a 
guidewire was placed. Contrast medium was injected resulting in 
complete opacification.(cannulation). A single stricture that 
was 10mm long was seen at the lower third of the common bile 
duct. There was severe post-obstructive dilation. 
These findings are compatible with extrinsic compression from 
the patient's known pancreatic mass. Cytology samples were 
obtained for histology using a brush. A sphincterotomy was 
performed in the 12 o'clock position using a sphincterotome over 
an existing guidewire. A 5cm by 10mm Cotton ___ biliary stent 
was placed successfully. (cytology, sphincterotomy, stent 
placement) Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum.

ACUTE ISSUES  
===============  
#Aspiration pneumonia
Patient was diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia due to fever, 
CXR with patchy bibasilar opacities and sputum culture growing 
H. Flu. An aspiration event most likely occurred in the setting 
of an overdose. He was started on IV Ceftriaxone, but as his 
clinical status improved, he was transitioned to oral 
cefpedoxime for a total course of 5 days. 

#Suicide attempt
#Schizophrenia
#Mood disorder
#Cluster B personality trait
Patient insists this was not a suicide attempt. However, 
collateral from patient's wife and past records from ___ 
revealed that patient has had prior suicide attempts which he 
denied, and has had recent changes in affect/behavior witnessed 
by wife. His wife described this episode as a suicide attempt, 
supported by the presence of a suicide note (which patient 
denied). Patient's wife expressed that the patient is not 
currently at his baseline (displayed isolative behaviors and 
frequent crying on the day of presentation and made a paranoid 
statement in his suicide note). Psychiatry evaluated patient 
during this admission and believe that patient is not 
psychiatrically cleared for discharge home and will require 
inpatient psych admission. Patient had a 1:1 sitter during the 
admission. Patient was continued on IM haloperidol decanoate 
(received on ___, and olanzapine was increased to 40 mg daily 
per psychiatry recommendations. 

#Agitation
Agitation was managed with PRN Haldol and olanzapine 20mg QHS 
and ultimately dubsided. His QT interval was monitored with 
daily EKGs. Discontinued sertraline while inpatient given c/f QT 
prolongation. 

# Elevated CK (resolved) 
Was likely elevated in the setting of taking hydroxycut. 
Downtrended to normal limits at the time of discharge. 

#Tonic-clonic seizure (resolved)
Witnessed at ___. While there received Keppra 1g, 
Ativan 2mg. Unclear if has history of epilepsy. ___ have been in 
setting of recent toxin ingestions, though again, patient 
reliably states he did not intentionally overdose or take 
anything new other than hydroxycut. IV Keppra was discontinued 
as EEG was without seizure activity. 

# Asthma (stable)
Patient continued on Albuterol inhaler Q6 PRN and 
fluticasone-salmeterol diskus 250/50. Medications On Admission: The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.

ANESTHESIA:  General endotracheal. History Of Present Illness: History obtain largely from Daughter in law and PCP, ___ (___)

History of Present Illness:  This is a ___ yo ___ female with a
history of a ___ secondary to an aneurysm with residual aphasia,
HTN, and hyperlipidemia and recent work-up initiated for 
multiple
myeloma who presents with leg weakness and multiple falls. 

Per the patient's daughter in law on ___ the patient had a
bad fall at home where she lives with her son and daughter in
law. She was down for 4 hours. She reported to her PCP that her
"legs gave out". She was seen at ___ where she had
plain films and a head CT that were normal. She received 6 weeks
of home ___ and was doing fairly well. When that concluded 
though,
she began a slow decline. She has had decreased appetite, a 
rapid
30 lbs weight loss and a few more falls.  She complains of back
pain and it is unclear whether pain or weakness has been the
cause of her falls. She also became incontinent of urine, but 
not
stool. Ultimately, 2 weeks ago when she could not even walk two
steps she went back to the ED where Xrays were negative. She 
went
to rehab. A CT was not done. At the nursing home rehab she
continued to have pain and weakness with not much improvement. 

Last night the patient was much more quiet than usual. This AM
she woke upset and in a lot of pain. She was screaming and
refusing to take her medications. The daughter encouraged the
rehab nursing home to send her to the ED. At the ___ ED she
received a spine CT that revealed, "Findings consistent with
multiple myeloma involving multiple levels and an associated 
mass
arising from T12 extending into the canal and compressing the
thecal sac significantly." Of note the patient can not have an
MRI due to the aneurysm clips. A left toes fracture was also
found on plain films.  The patient was sent to ___ for further
evaluation and treatment.

In the ED now the patient is in some mild pain, but reports
feeling ok.  Of note a year ago the patient began a w/u for
multiple myeloma. She had a biopsy done of the T12 lytic lesion
that was inconclusive. She then had a bone marrow biopsy that
revealed pre Kappa light chains, but no conclusive evidence of
multiple myeloma.

========================
Mr. ___ is a ___ man with a history of hypertension & 
hyperlipidemia, who presents several months of arthralgias, 
fatigue, and fever of unknown origin.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
==============
# POLYMYALGIA RHEUMATICA
# FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN: 
# WEIGHT LOSS, NIGHT SWEATS: 
Patient presented with fever of unknown origin, and concerning 
constitutional symptoms. Initial differential diagnosis included 
infection v malignancy v autoimmune/inflammatory process. For 
infection, he was ruled out for tick-borne illness, including 
Lyme, Rickettsia, & Erhlichia. Urine and blood cultures were 
with no growth on discharge. CT torso showed no pneumonia, 
abscess, or other evidence of infection or tumor. He had one AFB 
smear that was negative, another was pending on discharge, but 
suspicion was low. HIV was negative, and Hepatitis serologies 
showed immunization with Hep B and prior exposure to Hep A. For 
malignancy, his CT torso showed no evidence of malignancy or 
lymphadenopathy, and his diff/smear showed no evidence of a 
lymphoma or leukemia. For autoimmune process, ___, ANCA, and 
complement were within normal limits. Rheumatology was 
consulted, and suspected that polymyalgia rheumatica could 
provide a unifying diagnosis - prednisone was started and the 
patient began to feel better. He will continue prednisone until 
outpatient follow-up with Rheumatology. 

# HICCUPS, ESOPHAGEAL SPASM: 
Patient had episodes of hiccups thought esophageal spasm. DDx 
included medication effect, but also concerning for an 
underlying gastric malignancy (in family history) or a 
dysmotility (CREST syndrome). He was continued on a PPI, and CT 
torso was unrevealing. GI was consulted with EGD performed, 
which was unrevealing. There may be an anxiety component to his 
symptoms. He will follow-up with Neurology who also evaluated 
him for this issue as an outpatient. 

# HYPOTENSIVE EPISODE:
On ___, patient's blood pressure dropped from 130s systolic to 
___. He felt dizzy & lightheaded, so was placed back in bed. 
He received 2L NS, with appropriate response in blood pressure. 
He was started briefly on broad spectrum antibiotics 
(Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl/Doxy on ___, which were stopped on ___ 
when he stabilized. 

# TRANSAMINITIS: 
Patient presented with AST/ALT of 44/58, with an unclear 
baseline. He had no abdominal pain. RUQ U/S and CT torso were 
unrevealing. Hepatitis serologies showed immunization with Hep B 
and prior exposure to Hep A. These mildly improved before 
discharge. His statin was stopped for LFT abnormalities. 

# HYPONATREMIA: 
Patient presented with hyponatremia of unclear cause. Euvolemic 
on exam. Urine lytes without evidence of SIADH. He likely was 
hypovolemic, and PO intake was encouraged. 

# ELEVATED CRP: 
Patient had CRP 183 on admission, appears higher than value of 
23 at an OSH. Likely related to his Rheum issues as above. 

# ARTHRALGIAS:
He received Tylenol for pain control.

CHRONIC STABLE ISSUES:
======================
# RUE CLOT: 
Had been placed apixaban at an OSH, but he had no evidence of 
the same here, and his description was consistent with a 
provoked superficial thrombophlebitis. He was maintained on just 
HSQ while hospitalized, and discharged off anticoagulation. 

# HTN: 
Held home Lisinopril 10mg daily and metoprolol succinate ER 25 
mg daily given episode of hypotension, and normotension on 
discharge. 
   
# HLD: 
Stopped home Simvastatin 10mg daily for transaminitis. 
   
# GERD: 
Stopped Omeprazole 40mg daily as did not have acid reflux, but 
rather spasm as above.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
- Patient has the following labs outstanding at discharge:
[ ] ___: pnd

- Patient was normotensive while in the hospital. Metoprolol XL 
and Lisinopril were stopped, consider restarting after discharge 
if again demonstrates hypertension. 
- For LFT abnormalities, statin medication was stopped while in 
the hospital. These should be restarted after LFTs are trended 
as an outpatient. 
- Patient has solitary Right apical ground-glass nodule that 
should be followed up by repeat CT in 3mths
- If ongoing esophageal spasms after discharge, could consider 
calcium channel blocker or tricyclic antidepressant for 
treatment Medications On Admission: The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.

Radiology:
Nuclear Stress ___ - IMPRESSION: 1. New myocardial 
defects in the inferior wall and the infero-apical wall, both 
areas with partial reversibility. These findings are new from 
___. 2. Global hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of 35%. 
.
CXR ___ - IMPRESSION: Mild interstitial pulmonary edema. 
.
Cardiac cath ___
COMMENTS:     1.  Selective coronary angiography in this right 
dominant 
system demonstrated two-vessel disease.  The LMCA had a 
proximal, focal, 
calcified 20% stenosis.  The LAD had proximal stenosis to 30% 
and 
diffuse disease throughout.  The mid and distal LAD had serial 
focal 
moderate lesions before it completely occluded just before the 
apex. 
The apical LAD is occluded (appears to have been a wrap-around 
vessel) 
and fills via faint collaterals from L-R and R-L.   A large, 
bifurcating 
D1 (functionally ramus intermedius+diagonal) is free from 
obstructive 
disease.  The D2 is a smaller vessel and had a ___ proximal 
lesion. 
The LCx is free from angiographically apparent disease. Overall, 
it is a 
smaller system with a diminutive AV groove segment and sizable 
single OM 
that tapers distally.  The RCA has mild disease throughout.  The 
R-PDA 
markedly tapers distally and so does the long (reaches the apex) 
distal 
pole branch of the AM. 
2.  Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated 
right-sided filling pressures with a RVEDP of 16 mmHg.   The 
wedge 
pressure was also markedly elevated with a mean of 30 mmHg.  
There was 
moderate pulmonary hypertension with a PASP of 56 mmHg.  The 
cardiac 
index was decreased at 2.0 L/min/m2.  There were prominent V 
waves on 
wedge tracing suggesting significant mitral regurgitation. 
  
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease. 
2. Markedly elevated right and left-sided filling pressures. 
3. Moderate pulmonary hypertension. 
4. Low cardiac index. 
5. Significant mitral regurgitation. 
.
Transthoracic echo ___
Conclusions  
The left atrium is elongated. The estimated right atrial 
pressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are 
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is top 
normal/borderline dilated. There is probably mild to moderate 
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior 
akinesis and inferoseptal and inferolateral hypokinesis. 
Estimated left ventricular ejection fraction is ?___re suboptimal for this assessment. [Intrinsic left 
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the 
severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber 
size and free wall motion are normal (views suboptimal). The 
aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are 
mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. 
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
left ventricular systolic function now appears less vigorous and 
heart rate is now slower (nondysfunctional segments are now less 
hyperdynamic). Mitral regurgitation is now much more prominent. Medications On Admission: DIGOXIN -  (Prescribed by Other Provider: Dr. ___ - 125

___.

# Acute on chronic pelvic ___. Unclear etiology. She has been 
seen by ___, urology, and gynecology specialists in the past 
with extensive workup. She has had a hysterectomy and BSO. We 
did not find a clear reason for her ___. She improved overnight 
with 3 Percocet tablets and 1 pyridium. She sometimes declined 
physical exams and therefore, it was not always possible to 
evaluate her. Given that she presented with passive suicidal 
ideation, we were hesitant to escalate ___ medications. She was 
evaluated by Gynecology and Chronic ___ Service. Pyridium was 
added and morphine was changed to Percocet PRN. No further 
recommendations or interventions were offered. She has been 
scheduled to see Dr. ___ from ___ Urogynecology as an 
outpatient, and offer was made to expedite this process, with 
efforts ongoing to contact Dr. ___ inpatient evaluation at 
the time of patient's transfer request. As noted above, her 
request was honored and she was transferred to ___.

After extensive discussion with her outpatient ___ doctor ___. 
___ at ___, who manages her narcotics 
contract, decision was made to stop her morphine ___ and replace 
it with Percocet ___ 1 tab Q8H PRN ___. Continue long-acting 
oxycontin, gabapentin, duloxetine, and baclofen. She also 
endorsed chest ___ at various times, with unchanged ECGs and 
relief of symptoms without intervention. There may be a 
component of somatization disorder given her various pains and 
symptoms without organic causes identified.

# Suicidal ideation. She was initially placed under ___ 
with 1:1 sitter. After further evaluation, this was deemed no 
longer necessary. She did not endorse SI or HI the remainder of 
the admission.

# Bipolar disorder type. Lurasidone was not continued inpatient 
as it is nonformulary. Otherwise, her other medications 
duloxetine, lorazepam, and trazodone were continued. 

# Neutropenia. Patient's ANC 1360 on admission. Uncetain 
etiology. Patient denies symptoms of infection. ___ secondary 
to medication effect. Lurasidone and Elmiron can both rarely 
cause leukopenia.

IMAGING/STUDIES:
================
___ CXR
Enteric tube courses below the diaphragm, out of the field of 
view; gastric bubble appears distended. Endotracheal tube 
terminates 6 cm above the carina. Left base opacity likely 
represents combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis, 
underlying consolidation not excluded. 

___ CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST 
3.1 cm area of subcortical hypodensity in the left occipital 
lobe extending to the posterior horn of the left lateral 
ventricle which could represent evolving subacute infarct, but 
age-indeterminate. There is also subtle blurring of gray-white 
differentiation along the left frontal parietal vertex, which 
may represent an early developing infarct. Recommend further 
evaluation with MRI, if not contraindicated, for more definitive 
evaluation and to exclude underlying lesion. 

___ CT TORSO WITHOUT CONTRAST
Moderate volume ascites, bilateral moderate pleural effusions in 
body wall edema also likely reflect third spacing. Poor 
definition of the gallbladder, which may warrant focused 
ultrasound if there is concern for acute gallbladder process. 
Oblique, non displaced fracture of the upper sternum, likely the 
sequelae of CPR. Mildly displaced fracture of the anterolateral 
left seventh rib. Multiple fluid-filled loops of small bowel 
suggestive of ileus. Pars defects with moderate-severe 
anterolisthesis of L4 over L5 with moderate-severe spinal canal 
narrowing. Compressive atelectasis of the left lower lobe. 
Subtle ___ micronodular opacity in the right lower lobe 
may reflect sequelae of trace aspiration. Small pericardial 
effusion. Severe diffuse atherosclerotic arterial calcification. 


___ LIVER/GALLBLADDER US 
Multiple stones and sludge seen within a nondistended 
gallbladder. The 
gallbladder wall is thickened however there is no hyperemia or 
pericholecystic fluid, which is likely sequela from right heart 
dysfunction or fluid status. No evidence of gallbladder 
perforation. Normal appearing liver. Patent portal vein. 
Moderate right upper quadrant ascites. 

___ LOWER EXTREMITY DOPPLER US
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the right or left lower 
extremity 
veins. 

___ CXR
Interval placement of a right PICC with tip projecting over the 
right atrium. Retraction of the catheter by approximately 4 cm 
is recommended for optimal positioning. Otherwise, no 
significant change in lung and heart findings compared to the 
prior study. 

___ TTE
The left atrial volume index is normal. There is no evidence for 
an atrial septal defect by 2D/color Doppler. The right atrial 
pressure could not be estimated. There is SEVERE symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with a normal cavity size. There is 
normal regional left ventricular systolic function. Overall left 
ventricular systolic function is low normal. The visually 
estimated left ventricular ejection fraction is 50-55%. There is 
no resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient. Normal right 
ventricular cavity size with normal free wall motion. Tricuspid 
annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) is normal. The aortic 
sinus diameter is normal for gender with normal ascending aorta 
diameter for gender. The aortic arch diameter is normal with a 
normal descending aorta diameter. There is no evidence for an 
aortic arch coarctation. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear 
structurally normal. There is no aortic valve stenosis. There is 
trace aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets appear 
structurally normal with no mitral valve prolapse. No valvular 
systolic anterior motion (___) is present. There is mild [1+] 
mitral regurgitation. The pulmonic valve leaflets are normal. 
The tricuspid valve leaflets appear structurally normal. There 
is mild [1+] tricuspid regurgitation. Due to acoustic shadowing, 
the severity of tricuspid regurgitation may be UNDERestimated. 
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is high normal. 
There is a very small circumferential pericardial effusion. A 
left pleural effusion is present.

___ MRI/MRA Brain 
Global anoxic brain injury. Subacute infarctions in the left 
occipital lobe and bilateral medial temporal lobes. 

___ EEG
Periods lasting up to 30 minutes with diffuse rhythmic myogenic 
artifact at
___ Hz, sometimes with a left sided preponderance, and often 
associated with rhythmic face or jaw movements. This finding 
could indicate either cortically or subcortically generated 
myoclonus, and is highly characteristic of diffuse hypoxic 
ischemic injury. Periods of prolonged diffuse suppression, lack 
of reactivity, and diffuse slowing in the background. This 
indicates severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction that is 
nonspecific in etiology. Common causes include diffuse hypoxic 
ischemic injury, medications/sedation, and severe toxic 
metabolic disturbances
and infections.

___ EEG
Infrequent events lasting up to 10 minutes with diffuse rhythmic 
myogenic
artifact at 2.5-3.5 Hz associated with rhythmic head, face, or 
jaw movements. This finding could indicate either cortically or 
subcortically generated myoclonus, and is highly characteristic 
of diffuse hypoxic ischemic injury. Persistent diffuse 
suppression, lack of reactivity, and diffuse slowing in the 
background. This indicates severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction 
that is nonspecific in etiology. Common causes include diffuse 
hypoxic ischemic injury, medications/sedation, and severe toxic 
metabolic disturbances and infections. This pattern at greater 
than 72 hours post cardiac arrest is associated with poor 
neurological outcome.

___ EEG
One event lasting up to 20 minutes with diffuse rhythmic 
myogenic artifact
at 2.5-3.5 Hz associated with rhythmic head, face, or jaw 
movements. This
finding could indicate either cortically or subcortically 
generated myoclonus, and is highly characteristic of diffuse 
hypoxic ischemic injury.
Diffuse back suppression and lack of reactivity, indicative of 
severe
diffuse cerebral dysfunction that is nonspecific in etiology.

___ KUB
Enteric tube terminates in the distal stomach. There is an 
overall paucity of bowel gas. There are no abnormally dilated 
loops of large or small bowel. Supine assessment limits 
detection for free air; there is no gross
pneumoperitoneum. Osseous structures are unremarkable. There are 
no unexplained soft tissue calcifications. A cardiac pacer lead 
is
partially visualized. A rectal probe is seen projecting over the 
midline
pelvis.

___ EEG
Frequent events between 07:00 and 09:00, lasting up to 25 
minutes with
diffuse rhythmic myogenic artifact at 2.5-3.5 Hz associated with 
rhythmic
head, face, or shoulder movements. This finding could indicate 
either
cortically or subcortically generated myoclonus, and is highly 
characteristic of diffuse hypoxic ischemic injury. Diffuse back 
suppression and lack of reactivity, indicative of severe diffuse 
cerebral dysfunction that is nonspecific in etiology.

___ EEG
Frequent isolated diffuse myogenic artifact associated with 
rhythmic head
or face movements. This finding could indicate either cortically 
or
subcortically generated myoclonus, and is highly characteristic 
of diffuse
hypoxic ischemic injury. Diffuse back suppression and lack of 
reactivity, indicative of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction 
that is nonspecific in etiology.

___ EEG
Frequent epochs of diffuse rhythmic myogenic artifact associated 
with
rhythmic head or face movements. This finding could indicate 
myoclonus of
either cortical or subcortical origin, and is often seen with 
diffuse hypoxic ischemic injury. Diffuse background suppression 
with lack of reactivity, indicative of severe diffuse cerebral 
dysfunction that is nonspecific in etiology. There are 2 
pushbutton activations as described above. Compared to the prior 
day's study, there is no significant change.

___ EEG
Frequent periods of diffuse myogenic artifacts associated with 
rhythmic
head or face movements. This finding could indicate myoclonus of 
either
cortical or subcortical origin, and is often seen with diffuse 
hypoxic

___ following PEA arrest.
 
=============
ACUTE ISSUES:
============= 
# Status post PEA arrest
Found down with vomitus around him after an unknown amount of 
time on ___. ROSC obtained after 3 rounds of epinephrine, 
though patient lost pulse again briefly at ___ ___. Most likely 
etiology was stroke leading to aspiration and PEA arrest, based
on MRI/MRA brain findings on ___. Started on Keppra for 
prophylaxis. EEG initially with burst suppression activity, 
subsequently became more flat, and MRI demonstrated global 
anoxic injury, consistent with poor neurological prognosis. 
Patient was assessed by two different neurologists to provide 
two opinions; examination did demonstrate brainstem reflexes, 
however based on other findings, inclusive of lack of 
spontaneous movement off sedation (only having myoclonic 
jerking), the odds of meaningful neurological recovery were felt 
to be poor. Extensive family discussion regarding same; 
eventually decision was made to terminally extubate given poor 
neurological and renal prognosis. Pt died shortly thereafter.

# Acute renal failure
# Hyperkalemia 
# Hyperphosphatemia
Recent baseline creatinine ~3.0 since coming off HD. Creatinine 
3.2 on admission. No
improvement with volume resuscitation. Was felt to likely be ATN 
in the setting
of cardiac arrest. Creatinine continued to uptrend, and did not 
reach a peak. Patient was anuric with rising potassium/phosphate 
and worsening acidosis over the course of admission, requiring 
intermittent temporization. It was felt patient would not be a 
candidate for HD given poor neurological prognosis, as such this 
was not offered to the family. Ultimately became hyperkalemic 
with subsequent arrhythmias.

# Hypoglycemia
Recurrent hypoglycemia during admission, requiring multiple 
rounds of D50 over the course of admission. Eventually was 
started on D10W infusion to maintain euglycemia.

# Aspiration pneumonia vs. pneumonitis
# Acute hypoxic respiratory failure 
Noted on initial CT, mostly left-sided. Given MDR resistance 
pattern in prior ___ urine cultures, initially was started 
on vancomycin/meropenem to allow for broad coverage - 
deescalated to vancomycin/Zosyn per antibiotic stewardship team 
on ___. Given negative culture data, absence of fevers and 
normal WBC, it was felt this likely represented aspiration 
pneumonitis rather than pneumonia. Antibiotics were discontinued 
on ___ without evidence of ongoing or recurrent infection over 
the course of the admission. 

# VRE bacteruria
Growing VRE in urine, without pyuria on urinalysis. Was on 
ertapenem at facility prior to admission (D1 = ___. Sample 
was drawn from Foley, so unclear significance of same. Repeat 
urine culture grew yeast only, in setting of Foley use. No 
antibiotic therapy was started.

# Acute on chronic anemia
Hgb in 8s on previous checks in the last month prior to 
admission, had acute drop to
6.8 on admission, however with appropriate response to 
transfusion. Likely reflected combination of bone marrow 
suppression and anemia of chronic disease in setting of CKD.

# Transaminitis
Likely shock liver in setting of PEA arrest. RUQUS without any 
acute pathology on admission. Improved over course of admission 
given no further ischemic insults.
Aorvastatin was held.

# Hypertension
Was an ongoing issue since admission and discontinuation of 
sedation. Required nitroglycerin drip to optimize blood pressure 
control initially, but restarted home anti-hypertensive 
medications on ___, with subsequent weaning off nitroglycerin 
drip and resolution of hypertension. Continued carvedilol 25mg 
BID and amlodipine 5mg daily thereafter.

CHRONIC ISSUES:

# Acute pancreatitis
# Abnormal liver function tests
# Sepsis: patient presents with pancreatitis.  Not obstructive 
on MRCP.  No history of alcohol abuse.  Interestingly, does not 
have abdominal pain, but
left-sided chest pain.  There has been no nausea.  She was 
hypotensive on presentation to OSH ED, now improved, possibly 
from inflammation, no evidence of infection.  Started on 
antibiotics at OSH, then stopped when no evidence of infection.  
Patient tolerated advancement of her diet.  She should observe a 
regular low-fat diet.  LFTs were downtrending throughout her 
hospital course.  ERCP team felt there was no need for 
procedure.  She will follow up with her PCP, who can decide if 
she will need to follow up with Gastroenterology.

# Hypernatremia: likely from NPO status, fluid loss from 
pancreatitis.  Improved with PO intake.

# Chest pain: reports continued chest pain.  ECG without 
evidence of ischemia.  Cardiac biomarkers negative x 2.  
Acetaminophen was given for pain.

# Leukocytosis: mild, likely from inflammation, possible 
infection.  CTA chest with atelectasis vs. pneumonia, no cough 
or dyspnea.  Improved over course of hospitalization.

# Hypertension: held home lisinopril initially, but eventually 
restarted

# Anxiety: continued home citalopram

rituxan) who presents with fever. 

He had URI symptoms one week ago with a fever. He had viral 
panel
and CXR that were negative. He had been getting better over the
last several days. However, he had chemotherapy the day prior to
admission. Following this he started to feel sick again, similar
to his prior symptoms. He reports cough with yellow sputum
production, nasal congestion, and headache. He notes decreased

AST
128, ALP 174, Tbili 1.1, lactate 3.1 -> 2.1, UA negative, and
influenza PCR negative. CXR was negative for pneumonia. Patient
was given pantoprazole 40mg PO, Zofran 4mg IV, azithromycin 
500mg
PO, Tylenol 1g PO, and 2L NS. Vitals prior to transfer were 99.2
84 101/53 16 96% RA.

dysuria.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: A complete ___ review of systems was
performed and was negative unless otherwise noted in the HPI. Past Medical History: PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
This patient was seen by PCP with an elevated creatinine in 
___
and was referred to Dr. ___ from ___ here at
___. The patient had a new diagnosis of kidney disease
with an elevated creatinine from ___ in ___. Initial
Ptn/Creat ratio was as high as 2.4. The patient also had a renal
ultrasound done on ___ that showed that both kidneys
appeared normal.   UPEP and urine IFE showed MULTIPLE PROTEIN
BANDS SEEN, WITH ALBUMIN ___ KAPPA 
DETECTED
REPRESENTED ROUGHLY 15% OF URINARY PROTEIN BASED ON THIS 
SAMPLE'S
PROTEIN/CREATININE RATIO AND ASSUMING DAILY CREATININE EXCRETION
OF 1000 MG THIS PATIENT'S ___ EXCRETION wAS estimated at
15% * 1.6 * 1000 = 240 MG/DAY. Based on this pt was referred to
us to r.o MM. We did not have prior lab data to compare. Serum
IFE demonstrated IgG Kappa M ptn with 0.7gm/dl of protein. He 
had
a negative skeletal survey on ___.  His free kappa lambda
ratio was 12.82 with a ___ microglobulin of 4.49. The patient
was not anemic, did not show any evidence of hypercalcemia.
- BM biopsy performed on ___ demonstrated hyperellular
marrow with kappa restricted lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma with pos
MYD88 mutation detection. No plasma cell dyscrasia seen.
- ___: CT scans of the chest/abd/pelvis did not demonstrate 
and
adenopathy. Mild splenomegaly 13.2 cm was noted. Renal biopsy 
was
recommended by us to the nephrology team.
- ___: Underwent renal biopsy that demonstrated  acute on
chronic tubular injury, likely from the patient's known
___ proteinuria. Case was reviewed by hemepath who saw
evidence of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma in the biopsy specimen 
but
this was felt to be a fragment of an inadvertently sampled LN
rather than actual renal involvement with lymphoma. Case
discussed with Dr ___ recommended treatment of the 
lymphoma
that was causing the ptnuria from acute on chronic tubular
injury. This was reflective of the nephrology team consensus.
- Given absence of symptomatic systemic lymphoma, it was decide
to start treatment with single agent Rituximab.
- ___ and ___ rcd 4 weekly doses of Rituxan.
- ___: PET demonstrated no e.o lymphoma or lytic lesions.  
- ___: Evaluated by Nephrology and felt to have improvement in
ptnuria which was lower at 1.3 compared to ___ previously.
Additionally the percent/amount of ___ proteinuria was
less than previous values, but not completely negative. However
continued to have glycosuria, hypouricemia, and hypophosphatemia
indicating continued proximal tubule wasting. With so little
___ protein in the urine, it was unclear if there is
ongoing injury with this small amount. 
- ___: Case discussed again and felt that we should add Velcade
and Dex to the regimen.  
- ___: Started on BDR regimen (Velcade/Dex and Rituximab) for
treatment of ongoing light chain proximal tubulopathy. Ptn/Creat
ratio was 1.6 gm/day before starting Velcade.
- Rcd Velcade at 1.3 mg/m2 IV on days 1,___ and ___. Tolerated
cycle 1 very well with no complications.  
- ___: Ptn/creat ration decreased to 1gm/day after cycle 1 of
Velcade. Rcd cycle 2 of BDR in which rcd Velcade given at 1.6
mg/m2 and Dex ___ mg along with Rituxan on days 1,___ and ___.
LFT's were elevated during course of Tx. Lipitor held. 
- Course complicated by brief episodes of dizziness and diarrhea
after Velcade doses for a few hours that resolved by itself.
- ___: Ptn/Creat ratio improved to 0.7 gm/day. Given episodes 
of
hypotension/dizziness post Velcade administration and concern 
for
autonomic neuropathy sec to Velcade , dose of Velcade was 
reduced
to 1.3 mg/m2 and cycle 3 administered. Tolerated well with
reduction in dose. 
- ___: Ptn/Creat ratio improved to 0.7 gm/day. Given
neuropathy,dose of Velcade was reduced further to 0.7 mg/m2 and
cycle 4 administered. Tolerated it well with reduction in dose.

IMPRESSION: Preserved biventricular systolic function. No 
clinically significant valvular disease. Normal pulmonary artery 
systolic pressure.  

PATHOLOGY
===================
Skin bx, left lower leg (1A) (___):
- Mild papillary epidermal hyperplasia, compact hyperkeratosis, 
papillary dermal hyalinized deposits, and superficial and 
mid-dermal perivascular and periappendageal lymphocytic 
inflammation with numerous dermal melanophages, see note.
- Focal follicular hyperkeratosis with perifollicular fibrosis 
and chronic inflammation.

Note: The findings are consistent with a late stage of a 
lichenoid dermatitis such as lichen planus. There are clusters 
of colloid bodies and hyalinized papillary dermal deposits 
suggestive of lichen amyloidosis. The deposits stain with CK5/6 
and focally with PAS. Due to the finding of ___ 
inflammation, the histopathologic differential diagnosis 
includes a late stage of lichen striatus, but this is considered 
less likely. GMS and PAS stains are negative for fungi. The 
findings are not suggestive of infection. Initial and level 
sections are examined.

BM Bx (___):
DIAGNOSIS: HYPOCELLULAR BONE MARROW WITH LYMPHOCYTES, PLASMA 
CELLS, STROMAL CELLS AND INTERSTITIAL EOSINOPHILIC DEBRIS 
CONSISTENT WITH CHEMOTHERAPY INDUCED MARROW ABLATION. SEE NOTE.
NOTE: Correlation with clinical flow cytometry, and cytogenetics 
is recommended.
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
Peripheral blood smear:
The smear is adequate for evaluation. Erythrocytes are markedly 
decreased, normochromic and normocytic and have marked 
anisopoikilocytosis including frequent echinocytes and 
occasional dacryocytes. The white blood cell count is markedly 
decreased. Platelet count appears markedly
decreased. Rare large and giant platelets are seen. A 100 cell 
differential shows 1% neutrophils, 97% lymphocytes, 2% 
monocytes, 0% eosinophils, 0% basophils.
Bone marrow aspirate: The aspirate material is inadequate for 
evaluation due to lack of spicules and hemodilution.
Clot section and biopsy slides:
The core biopsy material is adequate for evaluation. It consists 
of a 1.1 cm long core biopsy of trabecular marrow and periosteum 
with a cellularity of ___. The interstitium consists of plasma 
cells, lymphocytes and stromal cells with eosinophilic debris 
consistent with chemotherapy induced
bone marrow ablation.

FLOW CYTOMETRY REPORT 
FLOW CYTOMETRY IMMUNOPHENOTYPING 
The following tests (antibodies) were performed: 
___, cCD3, cCD22, and CD antigens 11b, 16, 
19,33,34,45,64, and 117. 
RESULTS:
10-color analysis with linear side scatter vs. CD45 gating is 
used to evaluate lymphocytes and blasts.
A subset of the acquired events are in the low light scatter 
cell debris/lysed cell region with non-debris cells comprising 
53% of total acquired events.
The viability of the analyzed non-debris events, done by 7-AAD 
is 95.8%. 
CD45-bright, low side-scatter gated lymphocytes comprise 75.2% % 
of total analyzed events. 

Cell marker analysis demonstrates that a small subset of the 
cells isolated from this bone marrow are in the CD45-dim/low 
side-scatter "blast" region. They express immature antigens 
CD34, ___, and myelomonocytic associated antigens CD117, 
CD33, CD13 (dim), CD14, CD64, CD11b. They lack B (cCD22, cCD79) 
and T cell (cCD3) associated antigens and are negative for nTdT, 
cMPO. 

Blast cells comprise 3.5% of total analyzed events. 
INTERPRETATION
Immunophenotypic findings show the presence of a small 
population of myeloblasts (~3.5%). Correlation with clinical 
findings and morphology (see separate pathology report 
___ and other ancillary findings is recommended. Flow 
cytometry immunophenotyping may not detect all abnormal 
populations due to topography, sampling or artifacts of sample 
preparation. 

SPECIMEN: BONE MARROW
CLINICAL HISTORY: t(8;21) positive acute myeloid leukemia, s/p 
7+3, day 14 bone marrow
CYTOGENETICS PROCEDURE: Unstimulated culture for Giemsa-banded 
chromosome analysis.
FINDINGS: An abnormal 45,X,-Y,t(8;21)(q22;q22) chromosome 
complement with the Y chromosome missing and a translocation 
involving the long arms of a chromosome 8 and a chromosome 21 
was observed in 8 cells. 12 cells had an apparently normal 46,XY 
male chromosome complement. A total of 20 mitotic cells were 
examined in detail. Chromosome band resolution was 400-425. A
karyogram was prepared on 4 cells.
CYTOGENETIC DIAGNOSIS: 45,X,-Y,t(8;21)(q22;q22)[8]/
46,XY[12]
INTERPRETATION/COMMENT: 40% of the metaphase cells examined had 
the previously observed (___) abnormal karyotype with the Y 
chromosome missing and a translocation involving the long
arms of chromosomes 8 and 21. FISH has demonstrated that the 
RUNX1/RUNX1T1 gene rearrangement brought about by this 
translocation is in 16% of the cells in this bone marrow 
aspirate
sample (see below).
FISH: POSITIVE for RUNX1/RUNX1T1. 16% of the interphase bone 
marrow cells examined had a probe signal pattern consistent with 
the previously observed (___) RUNX1/RUNX1T1 gene 
rearrangement brought about by the t(8;21)(q22;q22) 
translocation associated with acute myeloid
leukemia with neutrophilic maturation.
Uncultured cells for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) 
analysis with the ___ Molecular RUNX1/RUNX1T1 dual color dual 
fusion translocation probe set: SpectrumOrange directly labeled 
probe for the RUNX1T1 (ETO) gene on ___ and SpectrumGreen 
directly labeled probe for the RUNX1 (AML1) gene on ___. This 
probe combination detects the
RUNX1/RUNX1T1 gene rearrangement brought about by the 
t(8;21)(q22;q22) translocation associated with acute myeloid 
leukemia with neutrophilic maturation.
FINDINGS: A total of 200 interphase nuclei were examined with 
the RUNX1T1 and RUNX1dual color dual fusion probe set and 
fluorescence microscopy. 168 cells (84%) had 2 red signals and 2 
green signals. 32 cells (16%) had ___ yellow (red-green fusion) 
signals, 1 red signal and 1 green signal. Normal cut-off values 
for this probe set include: 91% for a normal 2 red and 2 green 
probe signal pattern and 1% for a ___ yellow (red-green fusion), 1 
red and 1 green signal pattern. nuc ish(RUNX1T1,RUNX)x3,(RUNX1

IMPRESSION
MECHANICS: The ___ and FEV1 are moderately reduced. The FEV1/FVC 
ratio is normal. There was no
significant change following inhaled bronchodilator.
FLOW-VOLUME LOOP: Mildly reduced flows with an early termination 
of exhalation.
LUNG VOLUMES: The TLC and FRC are mildly reduced. The RV is 
normal. The RV/TLC ratio is elevated.
DLCO: The diffusion capacity uncorrected for hemoglobin is 
moderately reduced.
Impression:
Moderate gas exchange defect. Although results suggest a mild 
restrictive ventilatory defect the FVC
may be underestimated due to an early termination of exhalation 
and the RV is likely overestimated
and/or TLC underestimated due to a suboptimal SVC manuever. 
There are no prior studies available for
comparison.

LV mass pathology 
Mass, left ventricle, extraction:
- Partially organized fibrinous nodule (0.7 cm) with focal

Myeloma diagnosed last week in the workup of non-traumatic 
T-spine fracture who presents with acute on chronic back pain 
and new foot numbness. 

Mr. ___ recent medical history is notable for presenting to 
his PCP ___ ___ with one month of mid back pain. At that visit 
he reported that while he has a history of low back pain he had 
started to have pain in his mid back that was not getting 
better. On exam he was noted to have point tenderness along his 
thoracic spine with pain raditating across his rib cage. He 
reports the pain was better with rest and while supine on a hard 
surface. Was worse with activity and worse with wearing a 
backpack. He had a thoracic spine Xray which showed loss of 
height of T7 vertabrae and was referred to orthopaedics. An MRI 
T spine was obtained which showed:
 
"1. Multiple compression fractures, the most severe at T7 
without definite paraspinal or bone marrow edema to suggest 
acute fractures 
2. The visualized bone marrow signal intensity is diffusely 
abnormal with increased in STIR signal which could be related to 
hematopoietic marrow hyperplasia or an infiltrative process.
3. Slight retropulsion of fragments at the superior aspect of T7 
indents the spinal cord minimally. Dorsally the subarachnoid 
space is widely patent. Rostral to this level there is a ___ 
hydromyelia likely secondary to the slight mass effect on the 
spinal cord."

He was then referred to Dr. ___ evaluation. He had a iliac 
bone marrow biopsy on ___ the results of which are still 
pending. Blood tests showed an elevated IgG thus the presumed 
diagnosis of multiple myeloma was made and it was recommended 
that he start RVD + Zometa on ___. 

He reports that he was doing well up until yesterday when he was 
bending down to pick something up and had acute worsening of his 
pain. He reported that he also began to feel numbness over toes 
bilaterally. He had continued pain overnight and in the morning 
was unable to get OOB tonight and was unable due to pain.  He 
called ___ and was taken to ED.

was transferred to this hospital for further management. 
  
On arrival to this hospital her initial vitals were HR: 113 BP: 
124/95 RR: 14 O2: 100% on ventilator.  EKG showed sinus 
tachycardia.  Toxicology was consulted who recommended serial 
EKGs every 30 minutes.  She had a left IJ placed for access.  
She was started on vancomycin and zosyn for possible sepsis 
given hypotension and received an additional 2 L IVF.  She had a 
CXR without focal infiltrate.  She was admitted to the MICU. 
 
While in the MICU she was noted to have widening of her QRS with 
wide complex tachycardia which was responsive to bicarbonate and 
she required bicarbonate drip.  She received additional 
activated charcoal.  Her antibiotics were changed to vancomycin 
and meropenem for ventilator associated pneumonia given 
penicillin allergy and concern that fluoroquinolones would widen 
QT interval.  Given persistent wide complex tachycardia there 
was concern for pharmacobezoar and she had an upper endoscopy 
which was within normal limits.  She was extubated on ___ 
without difficulty.  Immediately prior to transfer she was noted 
to have a black tarry stool which was guaiac positive.  
Subsequent stools have been dark but guaiac negative.
 
On exam she denies pain.  She denies taking medications to try 
to harm herself.  No fevers, chills, chest pain, difficulty 
breathing, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, 
constipation, dysuria, hematuria, leg pain or swelling.  All

Conclusions  
Pre Bypass: There is moderate symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular systolic function is 
normal (LVEF>55%). The aortic root is moderately dilated at the 
sinus level. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The 
aortic arch is moderately dilated. There are simple atheroma in 
the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending 
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve is bicuspid. The aortic valve 
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is a minimally 
increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve 
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) central mitral 
regurgitation is seen. 

Post Bypass: Patient is AV (later A) paced on phenylepherine 
infusion (transient epi on seperation from bypass). There is a 
xenograft in the aortic/sinus position (#29 per report). There 
is no flow outside of the valve, no AI. Peak gradient 9, mean 3 
mm hg at a cardiac output > 7 L/min. Preserved biventricular 
function LVEF > 55%. Ascending/ hemiarch aortic conduit contours 
appear intact with laminar flow. Desending aorta intact. 
Remaining exam is unchanged. All findings discussed with 
surgeons at the time of the exam.   
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance 
with ___ regulations.

COURSE):
___ yr old male with no prior psychiatric history who presents
auditory hallucinations described as a running commentary 
arguing
if he is "gay or straight." He also says the voices sometimes 
say
"I am a faggot" or "I am stupid." He also feels as though the
voices can be heard by others around him. In this setting,
patient recently told his roommate about the voices so that he
would not be caught off guard when his roommate would hear them
as well. Per collateral from Dr. ___ school psychologist,
the patient appeared to also state that the voices were urging
him to make sexual advances towards the roommate and this was
conveyed to the roommate as well (although patient denies this 
at
time of interview). 

The roommate was concerned about this, voiced his concerns to 
the
Resident Advisor, and after a discussion with Dr. ___
patient was escorted to the ___ ED by a resident advisor to
have the patient psychiatrically evaluated. 

Patient reports the voices first began over a year ago in the
setting of him having a male classmate express interest in him. 

On speaking to his mother, it appears that the voices may have
started in High School. Furthermore, she reports patient having
an "emotional crisis" in middle school around puberty but was 
not

requiring blood transfusions in the past, hypertension,
arthritis, and non-obstructive CAD who presented via EMS for
weakness, found to have tachycardia and concern for STEMI in the
ambulance.

Ms. ___ is accompanied by her son and grandson. Today, she
was shopping with her grandson when she became short of breath,
and initially went to rest in the car for a few minutes while he
continued shopping. They went home and then she developed 
acutely
a "funny feeling all over" and right-sided chest discomfort. She
has difficulty describing this further. She did have shortness 
of
breath at the time, as well as abdominal discomfort and nausea.
She denied lightheadedness, presyncope, syncope, dizziness or
radiation. She took a SL nitroglycerin and after her son noticed
that she was very pale he called EMS at 2:50. On arrival, they
found her to be normotensive but tachycardic to the 200s. She 
was
given 100mg IV amiodarone with improvement in HR. Rhythm strip
was concerning for STEMI in III and aVF and code STEMI 
activated.
In the ambulance on the way to BI, she returned to feeling
completely normal.

On arrival to the ED, she stated she was feeling well, denied
nausea and vomiting. She denies any history of arrhythmia or MI.
She has never had an experience similar to that of today before. 

 
In the ED...

TTE ___

CONCLUSION:
The left atrial volume index is normal. There is normal left 
ventricular wall thickness with a normal cavity size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is 
moderately-to-severely depressed secondary to hypokinesis of the
inferior free wall and akinesis (with focal dyskinesis) of the 
posterior and lateral walls. The visually
estimated left ventricular ejection fraction is 30%. Left 
ventricular cardiac index is depressed (less than
2.0 L/min/m2). There is no resting left ventricular outflow 
tract gradient. Normal right ventricular cavity size
with depressed free wall motion. Tricuspid annular plane 
systolic excursion (TAPSE) is depressed. The aortic
sinus diameter is normal for gender with normal ascending aorta 
diameter for gender. The aortic arch
diameter is normal with a normal descending aorta diameter. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. There is trace 
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened with no mitral valve prolapse. There is 
moderate [2+] mitral regurgitation. The pulmonic
valve leaflets are normal. The tricuspid valve leaflets appear 
structurally normal. There is mild [1+] tricuspid
regurgitation. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: inferoposterolateral myocardial infarct

CXR ___

FINDINGS:  
  
In comparison to the prior radiograph, diffuse bilateral 
reticular opacities 
and septal thickening are improved compared to the prior study.  
There is 
mild-moderate persistent central pulmonary edema slightly worse 
on the left.  
There is bronchovascular cuffing.  Likely trace left pleural 
effusion.  No 
pneumothorax.  No large focal consolidation.  The heart is 
mildly enlarged.  
The mediastinum is stable in size.  Postsurgical changes after 
median 
sternotomy and CABG are demonstrated.

======================
___ is a ___ man with no past medical history who presented 
after a suicide attempt by ingesting Tylenol ___ (50g 
Acetaminophen + 2.5g Diphenhydramine). NAC was initiated 16 
hours later and his acetaminophen level was normal at 20 hours. 
He as placed on a section 12a hold and was treated with NAC for 
several days until his LFTs downtrended. He was then discharged 
to an inpatient psychiatric facility. 

ACTIVE ISSUES
=============
# ACETAMINOPHEN OVERDOSE
# DIPHENHYDRAMINE OVERDOSE
Known ingestion time 9PM on ___, NAC started 16h later 1PM on 
___. He was persistently asymptomatic with no abdominal pain, 
nausea, vomiting, and with no signs of anticholinergic toxicity. 
His acetaminophen level was negative approximately 20 hours 
after time of ingestion and his INR was persistently normal. NAC 
was continued until his LFTs downtrended. 

# SUICIDE ATTEMPT
Likely in setting of significant social stressors, legal 
concern, and poor social support (no friends he talks to 
routinely). First episode with no prior attempts. He did meet 
some SIGECAPS criteria for major depression (sleep changes, 
decreased appetite, suicidal ideation, difficulty concentrating) 
but given the acute time course it was difficult to rule out 
adjustment disorder. Psychiatry was consulted and placed a 
section 12a hold on admission. He persistently denied SI/HI 
throughout his hospitalization, appeared of normal affect, and 
reported a good mood. On discharge he was transferred to an 
inpatient psychiatric facility.

Conclusion:
Intrahepatic, extrahepatic Biliary dilatation with distended
Courvo___ appearance of gallbladder. Gallbladder contains 
sludge, no
definite stones. Common duct 12.4 mm. 
2. No pancreas duct dilatation seen. Pancreas head obscured by 
gas.
Further evaluation of the pancreas with CT recommended.
3. Otherwise Normal ultrasound survey of upper abdomen and
retroperitoneum.

ERCP: 1.5cm indeterminate stricture at distal CBD, successful 
ERCP with brushing and biliary stent placement across CBD 
stricture; biliary duct deeply cannulated with sphincterotome, 
cannulation moderately difficult, ___ 7cm straight plastic 
biliary stent placed successfully

CTA PANCREAS PROTOCOL:
Final Report 
EXAMINATION:  CTA PANCREAS (ABDOMEN AND PELVIS) 
  
INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with painless jaundice, head of 
pancreas 
obscured on ___ at ___// r/o pancreatic cancer 
  
TECHNIQUE:  Abdomen and pelvis CTA: Non-contrast and multiphasic 
post-contrast 
images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis. 
  
  
DOSE:  Acquisition sequence: 
   1) Spiral Acquisition 7.3 s, 47.2 cm; CTDIvol = 18.8 mGy 
(Body) DLP = 874.5 
mGy-cm. 
 Total DLP (Body) = 875 mGy-cm. 
  
COMPARISON:  None. 
  
FINDINGS:  
  
VASCULAR: 
  
There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm.  There is moderate 
calcium burden in 
the abdominal aorta and great abdominal arteries. 
  
LOWER CHEST: Minimal atelectasis is noted in the lung bases. 
There is no 
pleural or pericardial effusion. 
  
ABDOMEN: 
  
HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation 
throughout. There 
is no evidence of focal lesions.  A biliary stent is in place.  
There is mild 
intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation, and few foci of air 
within the biliary 
tree.  The common bile duct is dilated, measuring up to 1.3 cm, 
with abrupt 
cutoff in the pancreatic head (05:40).  Gall bladder is 
distended.  The wall 
is not thickened.  Hyperdense content suggests presence of 
stones or sludge 
within the gall bladder lumen. 
  
PANCREAS: The pancreatic body and tail are atrophic.  The main 
pancreatic duct 
is dilated, measuring up to 8 mm, with abrupt cutoff within the 
pancreatic 
head (05:36).  A side branch in the uncinate process is dilated 
to 5 mm 
(05:42).  There is a 6 mm hypodensity in the pancreatic head, 
just anterior to 
the stent (03:45).  No discrete masses visible, but these 
finding suggest 
presence of an occult pancreatic masses causing biliary and 
pancreatic ductal 
obstruction.  There is no peripancreatic stranding.  There is no 
vascular 
involvement. 
  
SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, 
without 
evidence of focal lesions. 
  
ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size 
and shape. 
  
URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with 
normal nephrogram.  
There are bilateral renal cysts, measuring up to 1.5 cm in the 
interpolar 
region of the right kidney and 2.2 cm in the interpolar region 
of the left 
kidney, as well as additional bilateral subcentimeter 
hypodensities too small 
to characterize by CT.  There are also peripheral striations to 
the nephrogram 
of each kidney suggesting either acute or chronic parenchymal 
disease versus 
fairly uniform bilateral appearance of scarring.  There is no 
renal stenosis.  
There is no evidence of stones or hydronephrosis.  There are no 
urothelial 
lesions in the kidneys or ureters. There is no perinephric 
abnormality. 
  
GASTROINTESTINAL: Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, 
wall thickness 
and enhancement throughout. Colon and rectum are within normal 
limits. There 
is no evidence of mesenteric lymphadenopathy. 
  
RETROPERITONEUM: There is no evidence of retroperitoneal 
lymphadenopathy.  
There are few prominent lymph nodes, for example, a hepatic 
artery lymph node 
measuring 8 mm (03:30) and a porta hepatis lymph node measuring 
8 mm (___:43). 
  
PELVIS: The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. 
 There is no 
evidence of pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  There is no 
free fluid in the 
pelvis. 
  
REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: Calcifications are noted within the uterus, 
likely 
representing degenerated fibroids. 
  
BONES: There is a mild anterior compression deformity of L2. 
There are 
moderate multilevel degenerative changes.  No suspicious bone 
lesions are 
found. 
  
SOFT TISSUES: The abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal 
limits. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
1. Mild intrahepatic biliary dilatation, and dilation of the 
CBD, with abrupt, within the pancreatic head, with biliary stent 
in place, as well as dilation of the main pancreatic duct and of 
a pancreatic side branch in the uncinate process, also with 
abrupt cutoffs in the pancreatic head.  Findings are highly 
suggestive of an otherwise occult pancreatic head mass.  There 
is no evidence of local invasion or metastatic disease. 
2. Mild anterior compression deformity of L2 is likely chronic.

IMAGING:
___ CARDIAC CATH:
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system 
demonstrated single vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA 
was 
patent.  The LAD was patent with mild plaquing.  The LAD 
bifurcates 
early giving a major D1 that supplies significant territory.  A 
plaque 
is noted in the pLAD just proximal to the bifurcation and 
extends into 
the LAD (30%) and diagonal (long smooth 30% initially and then 
tapers to 
80% with hazy appearance suggestive of plaque rupture).  The 
diagonal 
distal to the lesion is ectatic.  TIMI 3 flow is noted 
throughout the 
left coronary system.  The LCx is patent.  The RCA is a large 
vessel 
with mild plaquing in mid segment. 
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic 
arterial 
pressures with central aortic pressure 106/71 with a mean of 74 
mmHg.  
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     
1. One vessel coronary artery disease. 
.
___ CXR FINDINGS: 
The lungs are clear, the cardiomediastinal silhouette and hila 
are normal.  There is no pleural effusion and no pneumothorax.   
 
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiothoracic process. 
.
___ TTE: LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size. 

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA. 

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size and 
regional/global systolic function (LVEF >55%). No resting LVOT 
gradient. 

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion. 

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal 
ascending aorta diameter. 

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR. 

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR. 

___ VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial 
TR. Indeterminate PA systolic pressure. 

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen. 

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.  
Conclusions  
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall 
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are 
normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear 
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic 
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears 
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. 
There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic 
function. No clinically-significant valvular disease seen. Medications On Admission: ambien 10 mg qhs

hypothyroidism, and a distant history of bladder CA who 
presented
as a transfer from OSH with an L1 burst fracture with 4mm
retropulsion. The patient reports that he fell from standing
yesterday hitting his back on a chair. The patient states that 
he
was walking to the stairs to go up to bed when he slipped and
fell. No chest pain, palpitations, dizziness or lightheadedness
prior to the fall, and had not just stood up from seated
position. He was able to pull himself up after the fall, but had
severe back pain. He denied bowel or bladder incontinence, had 
no
post ictal state, and had no LOC.

On presentation to the ___, he denied
numbness/tingling, weakness or incontinence. The patient takes 
no
anticoagulants and no aspirin. He had a CT head non-contrast
which was negative, a CT neck which was negative, and a CT L
spine which showed an L1 burst fracture with retropulsion. At
this point, the patient was transferred to ___ for a
neurosurgical evaluation.

In the ___ he had an MRI which showed an L1 vertebral body with 4
mm posterior fragment retropulsion. The retropulsed fragment 
mildly
narrows the central canal. There is mild neural foraminal
narrowing on the left at T12-L1. Spine evaluated the pt and
recommended TLSO brace at all times, pain control and follow up
in 1 month in the ___ clinic.  

At 5 a.m. in the ___, he began experiencing relatively acute 
onset
of sharp mid abdominal pain and distention. This occurred 
shortly
after eating a large pack ___ crackers and drinking
multiple milk cartons. His last bowel movement was the day prior
to admission, and it was completely normal. He had no vomiting,
and was still passing gas. He was found to be focally 
exquisitely
tender in his periumbilical area, and thus he had a CT abdomen
and pelvis which showed cholelithiasis with gallbladder
distension and apparent mild intrahepatic biliary ductal 
dilation
raising potential concern for choledocholithiasis/cholangitis,
with a RUQ redemonstrating these findings with some concern for
Mirizzi syndrome. He was given a dose of Ciprofloxacin and
Flagyl. 

Surgery was consulted given these findings, however in the
setting of an exam which did not correlate with these findings 
as
well as normal LFTs, this was thought to be an incidental
findings which did not explain the patient's sudden onset
abdominal pain. The patient's pain resolved with a large bowel
movement in the ___.

The patient's UA showed large leukocytes, negative nitrites, and
the patient's abdominal pain was thought to be secondary to an
underlying UTI. He was given a dose of Ceftriaxone in the ___. Past Medical History: Dementia

Name: Arjun Kumar Unit No: 73965806 Admission Date: 2024-01-22 Date Of Birth: 1956-08-24 Sex: M Service: MEDICINE Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions Attending: Dr. Desai Chief Complaint: Generalized tonic-clonic seizure Major Surgical Or Invasive Procedure: None History Of Present Illness: The patient is a ___ year-old man with history of a prior seizure
in ___ (unclear circumstances) and alcohol use who presents 
with
three witnessed events concerning for seizure.  The vast 
majority
of the history is provided by the patient's two friends ___
and ___ and records, as the patient is unable to provide much
history due to mental status.

Per the patient's friends, Mr. ___ was in his usual state 
of
health until approximately 5:30PM this evening. He was watching
TV with his mother, when she witnessed him "having a seizure." 
His mother called the friends to come see him.  His friends note
that the patient's mother has baseline cognitive/memory issues
and is a poor historian; she was unable to give more information
about what she saw.  

By the time the friends arrived approximately 10 minutes later,
they note the patient was laying on the couch awake, but 
"staring
glassy eyed", non verbal, and not responding to their questions. 

He had a small amount of blood visible in his mouth.  

Several minutes later, they witnessed his right arm extend above
his head, turn his head to the right, make gurgling noise in his
mouth and clench his teeth tightly. This was followed by shaking
of the right arm, lasting "a few minutes."  His friends were not
sure whether the other three extremities were shaking at this
time. They brought him to the floor and thought it was best to
try to suppress the movements, so they held down all four
extremities tightly. They called EMS. After the event, the
patient remained confused as he was before. 

By the time EMS arrived, the patient had another event. This was
characterized by stiffening of all four extremities followed by
rapid shaking movements. This was associated with urinary
incontinence and tongue biting. He was brought to ___ and received 2mg of IV Ativan and 500cc NS en route. 

On arrival to ___, the patient was initially
noted to be nonverbal but responsive to painful stimuli. He
received 1g of IV Keppra, and was transferred to ___ for
neurologic evaluation and consideration of EEG monitoring.  

With respect to possible triggers for this event, his friends
note that the patient has a longstanding history of heavy 
alcohol
use "in bursts." He tends to drink when having a stressor or
significant life event. Last week was the anniversary of his
father's death, and friends report that "almost certainly" he
drank heavily for at least the last week. They do not know when
his last drink was, but do note that he seemed like himself when
they spoke on the phone last night. To their knowledge, the
patient has not been ill recently and has not had any recent 
head
trauma. 

They do note that he has had one prior seizure in the past, that
occurred at some point last year. This occurred while he was at
the grocery store and was witnessed by bystanders. He is not
followed by a neurologist and it was thought to be an isolated
event. No further information is known about the seizure at this
time. 

Currently, the patient is aware he is at a hospital and says 
"I'm
here because they said I had seizures." He has no recollection 
of
the events of the day. He reports he has been generally well
apart from having rhinorrhea over the last few months. Denies 
any
recent fevers, headaches, visual changes, nasal congestion or
other respiratory symptoms.  He denies any recent history of 
head
trauma. Denies recent falls. Denies recent fever, chills or
recent illness. Denies alcohol use (contrary to what is reported
by friends) or drug use. Past Medical History: History of seizure x1
-History of SVT per records. Friends report he followed by
Cardiologist (Dr. ___, ___ due to his
father's history of premature coronary disease. Family History: History of MI in his father in ___. ___ any history of

IMAGING:
Head ultrasound ___:
Palpable masses in the left lateral forehead correspond to 
vascular soft tissue masses which appear to have eroded the 
cortex of the underlying frontal bone and are continuous with 
the medullary cavity.  These are highly concerning for bone 
metastases.  Alternative consideration includes multiple myeloma 
or lymphoma.

Liver ultrasound ___:
Diffuse heterogeneity of the left lobe of the liver with 
moderate intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation in the left lobe.  
A discrete mass in the left lobe measures 7 x 7.7 x 10 cm.  Note 
is also made of an ill-defined hypoechoic lesion in periphery of 
segment 6 measuring up to 1.4 cm.  These findings are concerning 
for either primary liver malignancy, specifically 
cholangiocarcinoma, or metastatic disease.

CT Head ___:
1. Incidental note made of a 9 x 8 mm right distal M1 segment 
MCA aneurysm.
2. Subtle hypodensity in the right frontal white matter in the 
centrum semiovale. This is nonspecific, however given likely 
malignancy, MR head is recommended for further evaluation.
3. 2 lytic and soft tissue lesions centered in the left frontal 
calvarium extending into the overlying scalp soft tissues, with 
lytic involvement of the inner table.  No definite intracranial 
extension.
4. Although evaluation is limited due to recent venous 
administration of IV contrast, no evidence of intracranial 
hemorrhage, acute infarction, or mass effect.

CT Chest ___:
1. 3 left lung pulmonary nodules measure up to 5 mm.  Follow-up 
as per clinical protocol is recommended.
2. Diffuse esophageal wall thickening as well as enteric 
contrast material within it, likely reflecting chronic reflux.
3. Small right pleural effusion.
4. Healing left posterolateral 8 through tenth rib fractures.

CT Abdomen/Pelvis ___:
1. Enlargement of the caudate and left lobe with calcifications 
involving the anterior surface of the right lobe which appears 
smaller, has there been prior hepatic resection?, Alternatively 
this could represent cirrhosis.  Multiple hepatic masses with 
large hypovascular lesion proximally in the left lobe showing 
delayed enhancement with associated left intrahepatic biliary 
dilatation is suspicious for a cholangiocarcinoma.  Small 
arterially enhancing mass showing washout is suspicious for 
small HCC.  Large heterogeneously enhancing mass in the left 
lobe is difficult to be characterized, tissue sampling is 
recommended.  No evidence of portal vein thrombosis.
2. Large non-fat containing left adrenal mass is suspicious for 
a metastasis.  Small subcentimeter arterially hyperenhancing 
lesion in the right adrenal gland is indeterminate in etiology.
3. Multiple prominent gastrohepatic, celiac, periportal and 
portacaval lymph nodes.
4. Large destructive mass involving L4 vertebral body with 
enhancing epidural component encroaching onto the spinal canal.

___ MRI/MRA BRAIN
1. Two left frontal calvarial lesions erode both the inner and 
outer table.  
No evidence of intracranial extension.  Lesions could be due to 
bony 
metastatic disease unless proven otherwise. 
2. No evidence of intracranial metastatic disease. 
3. Approximately 1.5 cm right centrum semiovale acute or 
subacute infarct. 
4. Bilateral, M1 segment MCA aneurysms measuring up to 12 x 8 mm 
on the right and 3 x 2 mm on the left. 
5. Narrowing of the cervical spine at C3 level partially 
visualized on 
sagittal T1 images.  This can be further evaluated with cervical 
spine MRI. 
 
___ CTA HEAD
1. Lobulated right MCA bifurcation aneurysm with 2 dominant 
components, which overall measures 10 x 9 x 12 mm. 
2. 3 x 2 mm posteriorly projecting right ICA terminus aneurysm. 
3. 3 x 2 mm laterally projecting left MCA bifurcation aneurysm. 
4. Calcified plaque mildly narrows the proximal V4 segment of 
the right 
vertebral artery.  Calcified plaque mildly narrows the petrous 
segment of the right internal carotid artery. 
5. Again seen are two left frontal coronal vary ___ expansile, 
erosive masses with soft tissue component extending into the 
scalp, suggesting metastases. 
6. Partially visualized expansile, erosive mass centered in the 
right lateral mass and right vertebral body of C2, extending 
into the prevertebral space, and also extending into the spinal 
canal with mild to moderate narrowing of the thecal sac.  The 
mass extends into the right C2-C3 neural foramen and into the 
right C2 transverse foramen, encasing the distal right vertebral 
artery without evidence for narrowing. 
 
___ DYNAMIC LSPINE XR
Unchanged appearances of the known fracture at L4.  No evidence 
of dynamic 
instability. 
 
___ MR ___ SPINE W/WO CONTRAST
1. Enhancing large soft tissue mass centered about right lateral 
and posterior elements C2 on C3 with vertebral body involvement 
at both levels.  Epidural tumor extension at C2, C3 levels.  
Additional lesion at T 2.  Findings consistent with metastases 
or lymphoma. 
2. Severe central canal narrowing at C3 level, with cord 
flattening, equivocal cord edema. 
3. Degenerative changes remainder of the cervical spine, as 
above. 
4. Multilevel severe foraminal narrowing. 
5. Severe compression C3 vertebral body. 
 
___ TTE
Good image quality. Small PFO by saline contrast injection with 
maneuvers. Normal biventricular wall thicknesses, cavity sizes, 
and regional/global systolic function.
 
Bilateral Lower Extremity Ultrasound ___:
IMPRESSION:   
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the right or left lower 
extremity 
veins. 
 
PATHOLOGY

hospitalization.  She was given two doses of IV clindamycin in 
the ED, then transitioned to PO bactrim.  She is to take Bactrim 
DS BID for 7 days, ___.  Dressings are to stay in place 
until follow-up, she is to be non-weight bearing on the right 
lower extremity, and keep bilateral lower extremities elevated 
above the level of the heart at all times.  Pain was controlled 
with PO tyelenol, oxycodone, as needed. Ibuprofen should be 
avoided.  Physical Therapy was consulted and she was noted to be 
significantly below baseline level of functioning because of 
pain, so she will have a short course of rehab.

92-93% normally) and is s/p recent outpatient treatment with 
levofloxacin.  Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly and basilar 
opacities which are atelectasis vs infiltrates but she has 
recently treated for community acquired pneumonia as above, she 
had no fevers or leukocytosis during this admission, so no 
antibiotics were given.  She was given supplemental O2, her home 
inhalers, and incentive spirometer.  She was started on 
fexofenadine for seasonal allergies and reactive airway disease.

___ presents with increased frequency of seizures over
two weeks and a change in their character, as well as chest
pressure and palpitations.  

Her seizures began in ___, originally interpreted as 
psychiatric
and diagnosed as epileptic around ___ by Dr. ___. They
consist of two basic seizure types: 
1. "complex partial seizure" - consisting of left face 
twitching,
unilateral left arm and leg shaking, and some degree of altered
sensorium. They also may include bilateral tremors, jaw spasms,
back spasms - in the most severe kind for which she occasionally
uses a soft collar, but this component does not occur while on
medications.  She typically is aware of what's going on and can
hear voices, but does not always understand the words.  Over the
past several days these seizures have occurred "constantly" as
she comes "into and out of them" and sometimes is not sure when
one has happened or not.  The episodes are triggered by
photostimulation, crowds, too much activity around her, sleep 
and
food deprivation.  She reports that these episodes occur daily
and they can last for 30 seconds - 20 minutes and that she can
feel lethartic for hours after the episodes.  She can
occasionally predict when one is coming and she will take a
klonipin which helps to dull the symptoms.    
2. "staring spells" - consist of episodes of "deer in
headlights".  These last ___ seconds and she stares off and
hears what is going on, but has limited responsiveness.  She has
never lost consciousness.  She reports that on "bad days" she
will more likely have episodes of shaking and "complex partial"
like events that occur throughout the day and on "good days" she
will have episodes of disassociation ("absence") that are brief. 


She reports that as of ___ she will feeling better
than she had in years.  On ___ she felt that she had an
episode of numbness in the roof of her mouth accompanied by
inability to swallow water.  This event appeared to coincide 
with
one of her "complex partial" seizures and she believes that from
that point on, her seizures have worsened in frequency and
duration.  She spoke to the covering neurologist that day who
suggested she start the Keppra dosage (250 mg BID) that her
neurologist, Dr. ___ previously discussed with her.  

For the presenting episode last night, Mrs. ___ recorded the
event and symptoms as follows: "About 8PM experienced irregular
heartbeat for about 2 hours; heart rate was 94-114. Have had jaw
pain on and off for about 2 weeks; ignored it, thought it was
seizure related; added new medication Keppra 2 weeks ago ___. 
Tonight jaw pain, right arm pain, chest pain very light combined
with an irregular heartbeat. The irregular heart rate is gone 
but
the jaw and chest pain has not." She took an extra half of a
keppra, as well as 200 mg neurontin and 0.5 mg klonipin and 325
mg aspirin.

Finally, of note, Mrs. ___ has been taking neurontin for ___
years (up to 600 mg BID) for her seizures and for her pain from
her history of cervical stenosis, but ___ years ago she had a few
episodes of falling (no loss of consciousness) that were 
prompted
by an innocuous trigger, such as catching her foot on the rug. 
She refers to this as "loss of the startle reflex" - however it
is described as loss of the ability to catch herself or
compensate for tripping.  She feels this was associated with the
neurontin and it was decreased to 400 mg BID ___ mg TID per 
PCP)
and then it was weaned further to 200 mg BID two weeks ago when
she started the Keppra.

Relevant Imaging Prior to Admission:
Spine MRI ___:  
1. The cervical spine demonstrates a similar pattern of 
vertebral body signal intensity abnormality to that seen in the 
lumbar spine. This remains worrisome for malignancy.  
2. Hyperintensity in the L3 and to a lesser extent L2 vertebral 
bodies on a single sagittal long TR, long TE fast spin echo 
acquisitions remain concerning for local neoplasm involvement 
with paraspinal soft tissue abnormalities, better evaluated on 
the lumbar spine MR ___. At this point, biopsy of 
the L3, L2, or paraspinal tissue may be the best approach.  
.  
CT L-spine ___:  
1. Loss of L2-3 disc height and erosion of the central aspect of 
the inferior endplate of L2 and superior endplate of L3, which 
appears to be worse since the prior study. Associated 
hypodensity in the right psoas muscle is noted at this level. 
This findings likely represent discitis osteomyelitis. No 
evidence of vertebral body collapse at this point. Contrast MR 
study is recommended to evaluate for epidural abscess and/or 
involvement of the psoas and prevertebral soft tissues  
.
TTE ___:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. 
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal 
cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). 
Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic 
function, and a normal left ventricular filling pressure 
(PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, 
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets 
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and 
no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve 
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. 
There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen

IMPRESSION: 
1.  Mild intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation partially imaged 
without
evidence of acute cholecystitis. Gallbladder sludge without 
definite stones
seen. GI consultation advised with possible MRCP or ERCP to 
further assess
potential cause for biliary obstruction.
2. Markedly echogenic liver likely due to fatty deposition.

1.  Findings suggestive of hemorrhage within the pancreatic head 
tracking
along the mesentery and duodenum may be secondary to 
pancreatitis, however
underlying pancreatic mass cannot be excluded.
2.  Increased T1 signal within the right and left bile ducts 
suggestive of
hemobilia.
3.  Diffuse hepatic steatosis.

Radiology ReportCT ABD W&W/O CStudy Date of ___ 4:30 ___
IMPRESSION: 
1.  Necrotizing pancreatitis, predominately involving the 
pancreatic head.
Underlying neoplasm cannot be excluded and repeat imaging is 
suggested after
acute issues resolve. Extensive surrounding inflammation with 
duodenitis. No
discrete fluid collection.
2.  Nonocclusive thrombus within the main portal vein, 
intrahepatic portal
venous branches, splenic vein and possibly the SMV with 
occlusion of the
portal confluence.  Perigastric and paraesophageal varices.
3. No evidence of arterial pseudoaneurysm.

___ ERCP with stent placed in CBD
Impression:
Edema, erythema and congestion in the duodenum compatible with 
duodenitis likely ___ pancreatitis
The major papilla appeared normal. The surrounding duodenal 
mucosa was edematous and obscured the papilla. 
The scout film was normal.
The bile duct was deeply cannulated with the sphincterotome.
Contrast was injected and there was brisk flow through the 
ducts. Contrast extended to the entire biliary tree.
There was a 3cm stricture in the ___ with 
___ dilation.
This is likely secondary to external compression from severe 
acute pancreatitis in the head of the pancreas.
The CBD was 9mm in diameter proximally. No other filling defects 
identified. Opacification of the gallbladder was incomplete.
Given the significant surrounding duodenitis and the history of 
upper GI bleed, a biliary sphincterotomy was not performed.
A ___ x 7cm plastic CBD stent was placed across the stricture 
successfully.
Excellent bile and contrast drainage was seen endoscopically and 
fluoroscopically. 
Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum Medications On Admission: The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.

previously on anticoagulation for PE, transferred to the MICU 
from the SICU in the setting of arrythmias, most prominently 
tachyarrythmias, who originally presented to medical care on 
___ late morning after being found by his family, lying down on 
the sidewalk outside of his home, minimally responsive. He awoke 
at the scene complaining of headache and left shoulder pain. He 
was taken to ___ and then taken by MedFlight to 
___ after a CT showed extensive acute ICH. An EKG there showed 
sinus rhythm, with an S in I and a Q in III, with prominent 
upright T waves in precordial leads and no indication of 
ischemia. He reportedly started the flight being AOx3 and 
following commands and then deteriorated into lethargy and 
minimal responsiveness. He was intubated for airway protection. 
Of note, his INR was 3.7 on arrival to ___ consistent with 
coumadin taken regularly at home for known PE in ___. 
He received 2 units of FFP and vitamin K.  
.  
At ___ he was admitted to the SICU on the neurosurgical 
service. Ultimately, neurosurgery decided to observe the 
patient, start seizure prophylaxis, normalize INR (with a 
recommendation to avoid anticoagulation for one month) with no 
indication for neurosurgical intervention. He was diagnosed with 
a left humeral fracture for which orthopedics recommended 
splint. He was extubated on ___. An IVC filter was placed on 
___.

had not had recent falls prior to this. However, prior to his 
diagnosis with brain mets, he had a persistent cough and had 
some prior episodes, unwitnessed by family and only uncovered in 
retrospect, in which he coughed violently and then fell down, 
perhaps similar to this presentation. He was until this 
admission able to perform basic ADLs, ambulating, toileting, 
eating, etc; though with low energy and slow mobility. Past Medical History: Stage IV lung cancer with brain metastases diagnosed ___ after

Radiology:
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of ___ 8:09 AM 
FINDINGS: There is a hypoattenuating region in the posterior 
left frontal 
lobe along the falx with loss of gray-white matter 
differentiation extending 
to the cortex, not seen on the outside study performed 17 hours 
earlier, 
consistent with an evolving partial left ACA territory infarct. 
No 
hemorrhagic transformation is detected, and there is no mass 
effect or shift 
of normally midline structures. Small scattered hypodensities in 
the right 
subcortical and periventricular region are also seen on the 
outside study, 
consistent with age-indeterminate infarcts. Diffuse 
periventricular white 
matter hypodensity is consistent with sequela of chronic 
microvascular 
ischemic disease. The ventricles and sulci are prominent with 
prominent 
temporal horns of the lateral ventricles consistent with brain 
atrophy and 
medial temporal lobe atrophy. Atherosclerotic calcifications of 
the bilateral 
carotid siphons are noted. There is no evidence of intracranial 
hemorrhage.  
The visualized paranasal sinuses, middle ear cavities, and 
mastoid air cells 
are clear bilaterally. The bony calvaria are intact. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
1. Evolving partial left ACA territorial infarct from ___ 
without 
hemorrhagic transformation. 
2. Hypoattenuating foci in the right periventricular region are 
consistent 
with age-indeterminate infarcts. If clinically indicated, MRI is 
recommended 
for determination of chronicity. 
3. Mild brain atrophy with medial temporal lobe atrophy and 
evidence of 
chronic microvascular ischemic disease. 
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of ___ 8:27 AM 
FINDINGS: Patchy linear opacities at the right base most likely 
represent 
atelectasis. There is no definite focal consolidation or pleural 
effusion or 
pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable with dense 
calcifications at the thoracic aorta. There is a right chest 
wall pacemaker 
with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle. 
A fracture of 
the left fourth posterior rib is likely not acute. 
  
IMPRESSION: Linear opacities at the right base are likely 
atelectasis. No 
definite aspiration or focal consolidation.

Cardiology:
TTE (Complete) Done ___ at 3:40:10 ___      FINAL 
Conclusions  
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and 
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The estimated 
cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of 
aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic 
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The 
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral 
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is 
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a 
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function. Medications On Admission: Simvastatin 20 mg Daily

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease. 
2. Primary angioplasty to LAD and Cx. 
.
ECHO ___:
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild ___. 

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size. 
Severely depressed LVEF. 

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size. Normal RV systolic 
function. Cannot assess regional RV systolic function. 

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. 

AORTIC VALVE: Aortic valve not well seen. 

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Moderate 
mitral annular calcification.  

Conclusions  
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is 
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely 
depressed with near global LV severe hypokinesis/akinesis; the 
basal septum and basal lateral wall have relatively preserved 
function (overall LVEF= ___ %). Right ventricular chamber 
size is normal with grossly normal free wall contractility. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The aortic valve is 
not well visualized.   

EKG ___:
Probable sinus rhythm at upper limits of normal rate. P-R 
interval 
prolongation. Fusion of the P wave with the prior T wave. There 
is a 
single wide complex beat, probably ventricular. Low limb lead 
voltage. 
There is an intraventricular conduction delay of left 
bundle-branch block type with prominent inferior and lateral ST 
segment elevation. Since the previous tracing of ___ the 
rate is faster. The axis is more vertical.  QRS complex is 
wider. ST-T wave abnormalities are new. Clinical correlation is 
suggested.  
.
ECHO ___:
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed 
(LVEF= 20 %). There is focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall 
of the right ventricle. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to 
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be 
significantly UNDERestimated.] There is no pericardial effusion Medications On Admission: Ferrous sulfate 325 mg p.o. b.i.d.

IMAGING:
CTA CHEST (___):
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or acute aortic 
abnormality. 
2. Several foci of peripheral parenchymal opacities are noted in 
the right 
lower lobe and left lower lobe, with subtle lucent focus 
adjacent to the right lower lobe consolidation, which may 
represent early cavitation and given recent history of 
endocarditis, favor septic emboli, though nonspecific infectious 
or inflammatory conditions remain differential possibilities. 
3. Patient is status post tricuspid valve replacement. 

ECHO (___): 
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall 
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are 
normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear 
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic 
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are 
seen on the aortic valve. The mitral valve appears structurally 
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. No mass or vegetation 
is seen on the mitral valve. A bioprosthetic tricuspid valve is 
present. The gradients are higher than expected for this type of 
prosthesis. There is a moderate to large-sized (at least 1 x 
1.2) vegetation on the tricuspid prosthesis, with partial 
destruction of the prosthetic leaflets. There is no evidence of 
annular abscess. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation 
is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of tricuspid 
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] No 
vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Prosthetic tricuspid valve endocarditis. Moderate to 
severe prosthetic tricuspid regurgitation. Normal biventricular 
systolic function. No vegetations seen on the other valves. Medications On Admission: The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.

EUS was performed using a linear echoendoscope at ___ MHz 
frequency. The head and uncinate pancreas were imaged from the 
duodenal bulb and the second / third duodenum. The body and tail 
were imaged from the gastric body and fundus.
Pancreas parenchyma: The pancreatic parenchyma was homogenous, 
with a normal salt and pepper appearance.
Pancreatic duct: The pancreas was normal in size, echotexture 
and contour. No intra-ductal stones were noted. No dilated 
side-branches were noted.
Bile duct: The bile duct was imaged at the level of the 
porta-hepatis, head of the pancreas and ampulla. The CBD was 
dilated with a maximum diameter of 12 mm. No intrinsic stones or 
sludge were noted. The bile duct and the pancreatic duct were 
imaged within the ampulla. In the intra-ampullary portion of the 
CBD, a 5mm soft tissue lesion was seen. Differential diagnosis 
include ampullary fold vs malignant tumor.
Ampulla: The ampulla appeared normal both endoscopically and 
sonographically.  

ERCP w/Spincterotomy
Impression: The scout film was normal. The major papilla was 
normal.  
The CBD was successfully cannulated using a Clevercut 
sphincterotome preloaded with 0.025in guidewire.  
Contrast injection showed a dilated CBD but no filling defect.  

A biliary sphincterotomy was successfully performed. There was 
no post-sphincterotomy bleeding.  
The CBD was swep multiple times using a balloon. Small amount 
of sludge was successfully removed. There was no protrusion of a 
tissue mass at the ampulla during the balloon sweeps.  
A brushing was obtained from the distal CBD and sent for 
cytology.  
There was excellent bile and contrast drainage at the end of 
the procedure.  
The PD was not cannulated. Minimal injection was made. I

AFib, CAD s/p single-vessel CABG in ___, and pseudogout who is 
sent in from his PCPs office ___/ acute mental status changes in 
the setting of worsening productive cough and hypoxia.  His two 
daughters found him quite confused last night and this morning 
in his independent apartment at ___.  When they went to 
see him this afternoon he was in his pajamas, confused and 
agitated beyond his baseline.

Over the past few days, they had noted that he had developed a 
cough with a small amount of sputum production.  

Of note he recently had an episode of pseudogout, which was 
treated by his rheumatologist, Dr. ___, at the ___ 
___ with colchicine.  

In Dr. ___ he was found to be hypoxic on presentation 
(91% RA), with a productive cough, and diminished mental status 
(A&Ox1). 

In the ED initial vitals:  98, HR 97, BP 110/55, RR 16, O2Sat 
91% RA and work-up was initiated with CXR, head CT, u/a, 
chemistry and CBC.  EKG was interpretted as AFib, LAD, NI, no 
s/o ischemia and unchanged from prior.  Labs were impressive for 
an INR of 18.0 and hct drop from 43 in ___ to 25 today.  On 
further history taking it was discovered that the patient's INR 
hasn't been checked "in months."  Rectal exam revealed guaiac 
positive melanotic stool in the vault.  He was ordered for 4 
units of FFP, 2 units of blood and 10mg of IV vitamin K and GI 
was consulted.  He only received 1 unit of FFP prior to 
transfer.

A Head CT was checked and ICH was r/o'd.  Given his elevated 
WBC, he was given ceftriaxone and azithromycin.

K-4.1 Cl-106 HCO3-20* AnGap-___ on coumadin for AFIB coming in with greatly supertherapeutic 
INR, AMS, hypoxia, and GI bleeding with HCT drop.
  
Diagnoses:
  
# GIB:  He presented with a supratherapeutic INR of 18 and was 
given 3 units of FFP with improvement in his INR to 1.6. 
Spontaneous gastritis in the setting of the coagulopathy was the 
most likely source. EGD was performed and he did not show any 
signs of active bleeding or oozing.  Colonoscopy was performed 
and showed diverticulosis and two polyps the largest of which 
was removed. He received 2 units of PRBCs with an appropriate 
bump in his hematocrit. His bumex, lisinopril, metoprolol, 
aspirin, and warfarin were initially held. He was restarted on a 
diet and tolerated food. An IV PPI was initially started and 
then he was transitioned to PO. His metoprolol was restarted but 
his bumex and lisinopril were held due to low  blood pressure.
  
# AMS:  Thought to be secondary to acute illness in the setting 
of a GIB coupled with sundowning. Frequent orientation was 
helpful, and small doses of antipsychotics.
  
# Hypoxia:  He had mild hypoxia in the setting of a white count 
and dry cough. His chest x-ray was unremarkable, however he did 
have unilateral crackles. He was treated for a CAP with 
azithromycin initially but this treatment was stopped later in 
his hospitalization.  Exact etiology was not determined.
  
# Coagulopathy:  This may be secondary to a drug-drug 
interaction between his coumadin and colchicine.  More likely 
this was ___ either patient error administering his own 
medication or the fact that he gets his INR checked relatively 
infrequently (monthly) He was aggressively corrected. His 
colchicine was discontinued after discussion with his 
rheumatologist.
  
# AFIB:  HIs metoprolol was initially held but he had several 
episodes of AFib with RVR.  He was treated with 5 mg IV 
Metoprolol with resolution of these episodes. His Metoprolol was 
restarted and was titrated up to 25 mg TID. This was converted 
to metoprolol succinate on discharge. His warfarin was planned 
to be restarted the day after discharge. He was also planned to 
take enoxaparin unitl his INR was therapeutic.     

# CAD: Aspirin held during coagulopathy.
  
Transitional Issues:
Anticoagulation: Mr ___ warfarin was held in the setting 
of his GIB and elevated INR. His INR at discharge was 1.2. His 
warfarin will need to be restarted and his dose will need to be 
titrated up to his goal INR of ___. While he is subtherapeutic 
he should be treated with enoxaparin which should be renally 
dosed. Aspirin held at discharge. Decision about re-starting 
aspirin can be addressed as outpatient once HCT known to be 
stable with therapeutic INR. Medications On Admission: Medications:

(EF 60%), COPD, AFib, CAD, OSA who presented with shortness of 
breath. He describes developing sudden shortness of breath at 
home yesterday evening which woke him from sleep. He describes 
orthopnea at that point although he generally sleeps with two
pillows. He's had a dry cough for weeks, as well as insidious 
weight gain. He has been going to pulmonary rehab as recommended 
by his Pulmonologist, and underwent a session that morning. He 
thinks his diet has been the same, has not had sick contact. His 
only medication change was starting labetalol one week ago by 
his PCP.  He denies fever/chills, chest pain, lightheadedness,
palpitations. This morning he called EMS, who found him 
hypertensive to the 200s. He received oral nitro and was placed 
on CPAP on transfer.  

Of note, he had PEA arrest in ___ in the setting of hypoxia 
from a COPD exacerbation. He was diagnosed with AFib in that 
occasion and given an event monitor. He was also recently 
admitted on ___ with a CHF exacerbation which improved after 
diuresing. 

In the ED,
Initial vital signs: T 97.7, HR 60, BP 230/130, RR 18, O2 sat

Exam notable for: No exam documented.

EKG: Sinus bradycardia w/ 1st degree AV block (PR 219), old 
anterioseptal MI (T wave inversions I, aVL, V4-6)

Labs were notable for: CBC - WBC 7, Hgb 14.4, Plt 126; coags 
-INR 1.5; BMP - Cr 1; proBNP 1030; vBG 7.34/56/41 -> 7.42/45/55 
; lactate 1.6, trop negative.

Studies performed include: CXR - Moderate pulmonary vascular 
congestion and edema. Bibasilar opacifications likely reflect a 
combination of atelectasis and edema, however a superimposed 
pneumonia would be difficult to exclude. New elevation of the 
left hemidiaphragm compared to ___. Probable small left
pleural effusion.

Patient was given: 4 SL nitro en route (1 additional in ED), 
Duonebs x 2, 40 mg IV Lasix, ceftriaxone, azithromycin, 
apixaban, aspirin, labetalol. 

His ED course was notable for starting BiPap on arrival and plan 
for ICU admission. However, his O2 requirement decreased to 5L 
NC so he was admitted to the floor.
