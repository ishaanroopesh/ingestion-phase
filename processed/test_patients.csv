REASON FOR CONSULTATION: transient vision loss and dizziness
 

HPI: 

___ is a ___ year old male with history of hypertension and
hyperlipidemia who presents with 20 minutes of left upper outer
quadrant vision loss and vertigo.

He reports he has been in his usual state of health recently. He
got up this morning and went on a 2 mile leisurely bike ride. He
does bike in such a way that he has to hyperextend his neck. He
then came out and ate some cheese sandwiches and then went about
his day. He was working on fixing a door and was lifting and
straining but felt fine with this activity. Then he went and sat
on the cough and was talking with his wife. At 2:25, all of the
sudden he noticed that in his upper outer left field of vision,
he could not make things out (describes seeing light but
everything was very blurry). He closed one eye at a time and the
symptoms were still present with one eye closed. He also noticed
that he felt like the room was spinning. He got up and walked
into the kitchen and had to hold onto the kitchen counter. He
googled his symptoms and looked up things to check for stroke.
His wife checked his face, speech, weakness and sensation which
were all normal. He specifically says he checked for drift of 
his
arms and legs and there was none. After about 20 minutes the
vision changes and dizziness resolved.

He called his PCP who recommended he go to an eye doctor. He 
went
to Mass Eye and Ear and had a normal dilated eye exam. He does
report that there was a test in which the ophthalmologist held 
up
a large red box and he had this transient vision change with 
that
in which the very center (not left or right) of the box was
fading from red to black, but then these symptoms stopped. 

He has not been sick recently. There are no new medications. He
does report occasional palpitations. There is no headache or 
neck
pain.

Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.","Dear Mr. ___,  

You were hospitalized due to symptoms of ""20 minutes of left 
upper outer
quadrant vision loss and vertigo"" resulting from a TRANSIENT 
ISCHEMIC ATTACK (TIA), a condition where a blood vessel 
providing oxygen and nutrients to the brain is blocked 
transiently by a clot. The brain is the part of your body that 
controls and directs all the other parts of your body, so damage 
to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply can result 
in a variety of symptoms.
We obtained brain imaging and heart echo, which were both 
reassuring.
  
TIA can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having 
TIA/stroke. In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to 
modify those risk factors. Your risk factors are:  
[ ] high blood pressure
[ ] high cholesterol
  
We are changing your medications as follows:  
[ ] We have started you on aspirin 81 mg daily (baby aspirin)
[ ] We have placed a heart monitor (Ziopatch), the results of 
this will be communicated to your PCP and Dr. ___ 
___. 
[ ] Please follow up with your PCP, who will refer you to an 
Atrius Neurologist. An appointment with your PCP has been set 
for ___ at 3:20 ___.
  
Please take your other medications as prescribed.  
Please follow up with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.  
If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
 - Sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
 - Sudden weakness of one side of the body  
 - Sudden drooping of one side of the face  
 - Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body

On admission, the patient signed a conditional voluntary 
agreement (Section 10 & 11) and remained on that level 
throughout their admission. They were also placed on 15 minute 
checks status on admission and remained on that level of 
observation throughout while being unit restricted. Their sharps 
were restricted over the first few days as patient had made 
statement about wanted to shave her head so that others would 
not be able to recognize her. As her psychiatric symptoms 
improved, her sharps status was advanced so that she could use a 
razor and attend project groups, which she tolerated well 
without incident.

MDD
with psychotic features)
Patient presented with suicidal ideation and intent to swallow 
household cleaners. She was started on Risperdal, which was 
increased to a final dose of 2 mg PO QHS, with good effect at 
reducing anxiety, paranoia, and insomnia. Additionally, Zoloft 
was started and increased to a final dose of 50 mg PO daily, 
with improvement in mood and anxiety. She tolerated both 
medications well and did not report side effects. She also 
attended groups and participated in individual, group, and 
milieu therapy. Family (mother and sister) were involved in 
treatment planning and visited frequently. 
- The following medications were started on this admission: 
     Risperdal 2 mg PO QHS
     Zoloft 50 mg PO daily

3. SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS:
#)Cannabis use
Patient reported marijuana use several times a week for last 
year. Encouraged cessation and counseling, particularly given 
patient's paranoia and anxiety.

#) GROUPS/MILIEU:  
The patient was encouraged to participate in the various groups 
and milieu therapy opportunities offered by the unit. The 
patient attended these groups that focused on teaching patients 
various coping skills. Patient remained friendly, compliant with 
milieu. She usually stayed to herself..

#) COLLATERAL CONTACTS & FAMILY INVOLVEMENT:
___ (mother) ___- patient lived with her 
mother. Several days prior to hospitalization patient started 
staying in shelters due to worsening paranoia. 

On the discharge day, Ms. ___ was found in the day room: she 
had breakfast. She reported ""feeling well"". Denied any new 
complains. Reported that she feels ""much better"" with her new 
medications. She denied any side effects from the meds. She 
clearly denied S/H/Is. She asked to provide her with a letter to 
present for court. She asked good questions about outpatient 
treatment plan. She shared that her mood will pick her up from 
the hospital.

INFORMED CONSENT: The team discussed the indications for, 
intended benefits of, and possible side effects and risks of 
starting Risperdal, Vistaril, Zoloft, and Ativan medications, 
and risks and benefits of possible alternatives, including not 
taking the medications, with this patient. We discussed the 
patient's right to decide whether to take these medications as 
well as the importance of the patient's actively participating 
in the treatment and discussing any  questions about medications 
with the treatment team, and I  answered the patient's 
questions.  The patient appeared able to understand and 
consented to begin the medications.

RISK ASSESSMENT
On presentation, the patient was evaluated and felt to be at an 
increased risk of harm to herself and others based upon acute

Reports:

___ EKG:
Atrial fibrillation versus atrial flutter (flutter waves in 
leads II, III, aVF) with rapid ventricular response. 
Non-specific ST-T wave changes. No previous tracing available 
for comparison.
  
___ Cxr:
IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.
  
___ CT Angio Chest:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of pulmonary embolism or acute aortic 
syndrome. Small amount of loculated fluid in the right major 
fissure.
  
___ Echo:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is 
moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size 
and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). 
There is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular 
cavity is mildly dilated with depressed free wall contractility. 
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with 
good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic 
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. 
There is probable flail of the anterior mitral leaflet. An 
eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of moderate (2+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature of the 
regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly 
underestimated (Coanda effect). The tricuspid valve leaflets 
fail to fully coapt. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is 
seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. 
There is no pericardial effusion. 
  
IMPRESSION: Normal regional and global left ventricular systolic 
function. There appears to be partial flail of the anterior 
leaflet of the mitral valve with consequent moderate, 
posteriorly directed mitral regurgitation. The right ventricle 
appears dilated and hypokinetic with moderate tricuspid 
regurgitation and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. 
  
___ RUQ US:
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute hepatobiliary pathology.
2. Small amount of free fluid in the abdomen.","Assessment: 
  
___ with no PMHx who presents with palpitations and mild chest 
discomfort - found to be in new atrial flutter, TSH returned 
unmeasurable confirming the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism. 
  
Diagnoses:
  
# Hyperthyroidism: As evidenced by weight loss, tachycardia, 
heat intolerance, increased perspirations , tremors, diarrhea, 
joint pains, nausea.  TSH clearly indicates hyperthyroidism.  
Graves disease likely at the top of the differential given 
prevelance especially given elevated Anti TPO AB's.  She could 
also have a toxic nodule or subacute thyroiditis but these are 
much less likely.  The patient got a large iodine load in the ED 
so definitive testing could not be done while in house.   The 
patient was followed by endocrine in house who recommended 
starting the patient on Methimazole and Propranolol as outlined 
in the meds section.  She will need a thyroid uptake and scan as 
outpatient to determine the cause and definitive treatment of 
her thyroid disorder.
  
# Atrial flutter with variable block:  Unclear how long pt has 
been in this rhythm given report of sx x 1 month. Very likely 
this is being caused by her hyperthyroidism.  Patient was very 
symptomatic with this rhythm, especially with exertion.  Initial 
rates were very high and she was started on diltiazem in the ED. 
 Diltiazem was continued the first night while she was in house 
but was changed to propranolol once the diagnosis of 
hyperthyroidism was confirmed.  The patient was also started on 
coumadin for anticoagulation in house.  We considered 
TEE/cardioversion while the patient was in house but decided to 
defer this for now given that her thyroid function isn't normal 
yet and she may just flip right back into this rhythm.  For this 
reason we titrated up her beta blocker dosage and sent her on 
the long acting Propranolol and 3 mg coumadin daily with 
instruction to follow up closely with INR checks, PCP and 
cardiology.   On discharge her rhythm was A Flutter and rate had 
been in the 70's at rest, 100 with exertion.  There is 
definitely room to increase her Propranolol as an outpatient if 
she needs better rate control.
  
# RUQ pain: Pt had RUQ pain during the first few days of 
admission.   She had elevated LFT's and this was attributed to 
hepatic congestion secondary to decreased forward flow.  Her 
LFTs trended down during admission but not back to normal.  
Likely these will not normalize until she is back in NSR.   RUQ 
US read with no acute process.  She was afebrile without white 
count so infection unlikely.  Was given acetaminophen and 
Morphine for pain control
  
# Gatroesophageal Reflux Disease: Pt condtinued on ranitidine 
150 mg qday.
  
Transitional Issues:
1. Patient needs a radioactive thyroid uptake scan as an 
outpatient to determine definitive cause of her hyperthyoridism.
2. Patient will likely need cardioversion following 
normalization of her TFT's.  In the mean time we can uptitrate 
her propranolol for rate control as needed.
3. Given the hypercoagulable nature of her rhythm she should not 
be transitioned to an estrogen containing birth control at this 
time (Depo is fine given it is progestin only).  She would be a 
good candidate for an IUD.","Depo-provera

STUDIES 
EKG ___
Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. 
___ wave changes. Low voltage in the limb leads. 
No previous tracing available for comparison.
.
TTE ___
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Overall left ventricular 
systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= ___. 
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more 
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right 
ventricular chamber size is normal. with mild global free wall 
hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened 
but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation 
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. 
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate 
to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is 
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. [In the setting 
of at least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the 
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be 
underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.] 
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There is a small 
pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space which most 
likely represents a prominent fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Severely depressed LV systolic dysfunction with 
anterior/anteroseptal akinesis and hypokinesis of all segments 
bar basal inferior/inferolateral segments. Dilated and depressed 
right ventricle. Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation likely 
due to leaflet tethering. Moderate to severe tricuspid 
regurgitation. At least moderate pulmonary hypertension.
.
Chest Xray ___
Moderate bilateral pleural effusions layer dependently. Cardiac 
silhouette
has a peculiar shape, and a larger than expected component to 
the right of
midline. Whether this is due to cardiomegaly or pericardial 
effusion is
indeterminate. There is no particular distention of either 
pulmonary or
mediastinal vasculature to suggest one or the other. Bibasilar 
atelectasis is relatively mild, and there is no pulmonary edema. 
Aortic contour is normal.
.
___
When compared to the study of ___, there is continued 
enlargement of the
cardiac silhouette with evidence of elevated pulmonary venous 
pressure. The
right heart border is now sharply seen, as is the hemidiaphragm, 
consistent
with substantial decrease in pleural effusion. However, this 
could represent a more erect position of the patient rather than 
significant fluid decrease.
 
There is opacification at the left base consistent with a small 
effusion on
this side.","(___) with recurrent pneumonia, exudative

It was a pleasure taking part in your care during this 
hospitalization.  You came to the hospital because you had 
severe left lower leg and foot pain.  You were evaluated by 
rheumatology who felt that at least part of this pain was due to 
gout.  You also were found to have an infection in your blood 
stream.  You were evaluated by podiatry who helped drain a fluid 
collection and found that the infection had spread to part of 
your bone. You will need antibiotics for about 6 weeks to help 
fully clear this infection.  You also developed weakness of your 
left arm, and MRI of your spine revealed another abscess near 
your spine cord.  This was drained and the strength in your arm 
began to improve.  

The physical therapist feel that you will benefit from 
additional therapy at a rehabilitation facility.  You will also 
be able to receive you antibiotics there.  I was wonderful 
meeting you and we wish you a speedy recovery.

We have made the following changes to your medications:
-START: Daptomycin, an antibiotic until ___.
-START: Fluconazole, an anti-fungal until ___
-START: Metoprolol, this is for your blood pressure, it takes 
the place of Atenolol, which you should stop.
-STOP: Torsemide
-DECREASE: Prednisone to 5 mg daily, your last dose should be

-Your blood sugars were very well controlled so you should STOP 
Lantus for now and only use Humalog sliding scale to control 
your blood sugars
-STOP: Calcitriol and calcium carbonate.
-START: Calcium acetate 

Please continue to take your other medications as previously 
prescribed.  

It is also important to follow up with your primary care doctor 
and nephrologist (kidney doctor) when you leave rehab.  You 
should also carefully note the appointments listed below which 
are with the rheumatologist (joint and gout doctor) and 
podiatrist (foot doctor).  *** ORTHO ***",".
.
# Fungemia (C albicans)
The patient was noted to be growing ___ albicans from a 
blood culture dated ___.  He was started on micafungin and 
surveillance fungal blood cultures were sent and subsequently 
returned negative.  An ophthalmic evaluation did not reveal 
evidence of fungal endophthalmitis.  He was transitioned to 
fluconazole po, which he is to take for a total of a 2 week 
course starting from the date of his first negative blood 
culture; completing on ___.

# C7 Epidural abscess
In the evening of ___, patient reported that his LUE felt weak. 
 On exam, he was noted to have significant weakness with 
extension of his LUE, including triceps, wrist and fingers.  An 
MR of the Cspine was concerning for an epidural abscess at C7.  
He was taken to the OR on ___ for C5-T1 laminectomy and 
epidural abscess drainage and he tolerated the procedure well.  
The abscess fluid that was drained also grew MSSA.  His 
anticoagulation was transiently held (48 hours) while the 
surgical drain was in place.  The drain was d/c without 
incident.  The patient denied subsequent neck pain and his LUE 
weakness slowly began to improve. He continues to have 
difficulties with left finger (digit ___ extension and weakness 
particuarly with tricep extension.  Flexion of the LUE and grip 
strength remain relatively preserved.  Orthopedics will follow 
up patient as an outpatient though appointments have not been 
scheduled yet. Orthopedics contacted morning of discharge and 
will schedule an outpatient appointment.
.
# Osteomyelitis
After the patient's bedside aspiration by podatry, he was taken 
to the OR for an I&D and bone biopsy.  The patient's bone biopsy 
began growing MSSA as well and the pathology was consistent with 
acute osteomyelitis.  The patient went for subsequent wash out 
of the wound, and cultures continued to grow MSSA.  As above, he 
is to continue on daptomycin for at least six weeks following 
his last foot wash out, last dose is to be ___ unless 
otherwise directed.  He is to remain non-weight bearing on his 
left lower extremity until follow up appointment by podiatry. 
Again, Podiatry is scheduling appointment though follow up visit 
has not been made by discharge time. The patient is also to 
remain with wound vac set at settings in Page I and to be 
changed Q3 days. This should remain in place until specified by 
Podiatry.

# Gout
The patient had previously been diagnosed with gout based on 
symptoms and elevated uric acid level.  He presented with an 
erythematous and tender right ___ metacarpal head and an 
erythematous, swollen diffusely tender left ankle.  He underwent 
a left ankle arthrocentesis by rheumatology, the analysis of 
which was significant for 12,500 WBCs and monosodium urate 
crystals c/w gout. No microorganisms were noted on gram stain 
and the initial fluid culture was negative.  The patient 
underwent a subsequent aspiration of a fluid collection on the 
lateral aspect of his left foot by podiatry, which revealed MSSA 
in additional to multiple monosodium urate crystals.  He had 
been started on prednisone by his PCP even prior to admission.  
This was continued as an inpatient and tapered down given his 
concurrent infection and as his pain improved.  His last dose of 
prednisone is to be ___.  He was not started on uric acid 
lowering therapy during this admission as he was in an acute 
flair of his gout.  He is to follow up with rheumatology in 4 
weeks.
  
# Anemia: Chronically anemic likely related to anemia of chronic 
disease and chronic kidney disease causing poor EPO production. 
On day of discharge his Hct level was 22.5. There was no active 
sources of bleeding or hemolysis and his hct should be monitored 
while he is in an ___ facility to monitor for stability of Hct. 
He did not require transfusion during this admission.
  
# Chronic Kidney Disease, Stage 4
The underlying etiology of his CKD was felt to be secondary to 
his DM.  His kidney function was carefully monitored and all 
medications were renally dosed.  He was monitored with the 
assistance of the nephrology team in order to preserve his 
current kidney function.  Regardless, the patient should follow 
up with his outpatient nephrologist for follow up when his is 
discharged.

# Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance
The patient's initial compliants of unintentional weight loss 
associated with night sweats and subjective fevers was 
concerning for malignancy.  A repeat SPEP was sent and as per 
report from his primary oncologist, was consistent with prior.

# Insulin dependant diabetes mellitus
The patients blood sugars were carefully monitored given the 
concern for early Charcot joint and changing doses of prednisone 
therapy.  His insulin therapy was down titrated when he had an 
episode of am hypoglycemia.  The patient reported feeling well 
at the time, but did experience some dizziness.  With 
downtitration of Prednisone dosing the patient required less 
insulin. Lantus was discontinued and his blood sugars were 
controlled with Humalog Insulin Sliding Scale. He should remain 
on HISS while at ___. If his blood sugars remain uncontrolled 
then he should be restarted on Lantus based on the daily 
requirement of Humalog.
  
# Hypertension
The patient's home antihypertensives were initially held given 
his bacteremia and the concern that his infection may worsen.  
He remained hemodynamically stable throughout his hospital stay. 
 As his clinic status improved, his antihypertensives were 
restarted.  Although toresemide has been discontinued and he was 
given metoprolol in place of his atenolol given his CKD. His 
hypertension remains not at goal <130/80 but were not titrated 
further. Would defer to outpatient Nephrologist regarding next 
steps in management of his hypertension.
.
# Right elevated hemidiaphragm: 
Noted in his prior medical chart, dating back to at least ___.  
The etiology is not entirely clear although it was felt to be 
stable and there were no interventions during this 
hospitalization.
.  
# Transaminitis: Elevated but stable without rise in T.Bili or 
INR. This is likely the result of Fluonazole for Fungemia and 
will likely resolve after completion of course. Should follow 
AST/ALT/T.Bili closely

with one week of acute onset abdominal pain. He describes the 
pain as colicy and it lasts seconds. The pain began one week 
ago. He reports chills and cold sweats. He denies any subjetive 
fevers. He decided to go to the ED on ___ morning for 
further evaluation. In the ED they performed a CT exam and found 
isolated elevated liver enzymes. The CT showed mildly dilated 
and fluid-filled loops of jejunum that could be seen with a 
focal ileus which may reflect a mild inflammatory process such 
as gastroenteritis. He was discharged home.  
.
On ___ night he again had an episode of severe pain that 
woke him up at night and came to the ED again for evaluation. In 
the ED they performed a KUB which showed air-fluid levels which 
are non-specific without evidence for bowel dilatation; 
obstruction was not entirely excluded however. They also 
performed an ultrasound of the liver which showed no evidence of 
acute cholecystitis. The exam also showed fatty infiltration of 
the liver, although other forms of more advanced liver disease, 
including cirrhosis, could not be excluded. 
. 
Since his admission on ___, he has not had a bowel 
movement. He reporets that prior to two days ago his stool was 
normal without melena or blood. He denies any diarrhea or 
constipation. He also has been unable to eat for the past two 
days. He says he has lost his appetite. He says his lack of 
appetite is not secondary to nausea or abdominal pain. The 
patient says he occasionally has nausea and feels like vomiting, 
but has not vomited since his pain began one week ago. The pain 
returned again last night and he decided to come to the ED for 
IV antibiotics. 
. 
Of note he has been diagnosed with H. pylori in the past but did 
not complete a full treatment course. 
.  
Initial VS in the ED: 96.4 66 165/110 18 100% 
.
Patient was given 2L NS and morphine 2mg and required oxygen for 
desaturation to 91% afterward. He was admitted for futher 
workup.

possible the patient has underlying viral hepatitis, the 
serologies were sent in the ED. We are reassured by downtrending 
LFTs. Iron studies were within normal limits making 
hemochromotosis less likely. The patient felt significant relief 
with his bowel movement, and therefore it is likely he had a 
degree of constipation contributing to his presentation. 
Troponins were negative and EKG was unremarkable making a 
cardiac etiology unlikely. He tolerated food well and his pain 
was significantly improved with minimal need for oxycodone.

floor, his acute pancreatitis was treated with aggressive IV 
fluids, NPO, and IV pain medications. Mr. ___ transitioned 
to clear liquids and PO pain meds, but after worsening abdominal 
exam and KUB consistent with ileus, he was put back on NPO and 
IV meds. Following this, when Mr. ___ pain was controlled 
on PO morphine 15 mg Q4H, his diet was advanced from sips to 
clear liquids and his pain regimen was tapered from Q4H to Q6H. 
When his diet was advanced to full, he had a return of vomiting, 
loose stools, and pain with solid foods. The team decidided on 
conservative management such that he was him NPO until he did 
not need narcotic pain medications. Once he was weaned from

16 and MBI of only 1.6. His Troponin was remarkably low at 0.02, 
so it was thought to be due to his injury +/- cocaine use (serum 
tox +).  His EKG showed new TWI in aVL, and V1-V3, but this 
remained consistent throughout admission and two additional sets 
of cardiac enzymes demonstrated decreasing CK's and Troponin's 
<0.01

PRIMARY REASON FOR ADMISSION
=============================
___ yo F with a history of biopsy-proven giant cell arteritis 
admitted with elevated inflammatory markers and bilateral blurry 
vision concerning for flare of arteritis. 
.
=============================
ACTIVE ISSUES
=============================
#) Temporal arteritis: The patient presented with elevated 
inflammatory markers (CRP 80.4, ESR 63 on admission) and blurry 
vision concerning for GCA flare. She had not improved as an 
outpatient even after an empiric increase in prednisone from 10 
to 20mg. She received one dose of 1g solumedrol and was 
evaluated by both Opthalmology and Rheumatology. After 
recieiving the solumedrol pulse, her symptoms subjectively began 
to improve. Because the opthalamologic exam did not find 
anterior ischemic neuropathy on funduscopic examination, 
Rheumatology recommended a four week course of prednisone 50mg.  
She will need inflammatory markers checked q2-3 days until a 
steady downtrend is noted (discharge labs:CRP 34).
.
#) Hyponatremia: The patient has had hyponatremia noted at her 
ECF, with Na in the 125-130 range that improves with IV saline. 
Admission Na was 125 that improved to 133 with small NS boluses, 
her home salt tabs, and improved po intake.
.
#) Anemia: She has a history of iron deficiency anemia with 
likely component of chronic inflammation. Normocytic during this 
admission with stable blood counts.
.

You were admitted to ___ for 
evaluation and treatment of your injuries after a fall. Please 
follow the instructions below to continue your recovery:

Apply ice: Ice helps decrease swelling and pain. Ice may also 
help prevent tissue damage. Use an ice pack or put crushed ice 
in a plastic bag. Cover it with a towel and place it on your 
face for 15 to 20 minutes every hour as directed.
Keep your head elevated: Keep you head above the level of your 
heart as often as you can. This will help decrease swelling and 
pain. Prop your head on pillows or blankets to keep it elevated 
comfortably.
Avoid putting pressure on your face:
-Do not sleep on the injured side of your face. Pressure on the 
area of your injury may cause further damage.
-Sneeze with your mouth open to decrease pressure on your broken 
facial bones. Too much pressure from a sneeze may cause your 
broken bones to move and cause more damage.
-Try not to blow your nose because it may cause more damage if 
you have a fracture near your eye. The pressure from blowing 
your nose may pinch the nerve of your eye and cause permanent 
damage.

Contact your primary healthcare provider ___:
You have double vision or you suddenly have problems with your 
eyesight.
You have questions or concerns about your condition or care.

Return to the emergency department if:

You suddenly have trouble chewing or swallowing.
You suddenly feel lightheaded and short of breath.
You have chest pain when you take a deep breath or cough. You 
may cough up blood.
Your arm or leg feels warmer, more tender, or more painful. It 
may look swollen and red.

Regarding your knee injury:
Rest your knee so it can heal. Limit activities that increase 
your pain.
Ice can help reduce swelling. Wrap ice in a towel and put it on 
your knee for as long and as often as directed.
Compression with a brace or bandage can help reduce swelling. 
Use a brace or bandage only as directed.
Elevation helps decrease pain and swelling. Elevate your knee

ACUTE ISSUES:
=============
#GI BLEED/ANEMIA: No prior history of GI bleed, but confirmed 
prior history of hemorrhoids. No prior EGD or colonoscopy per 
patient history. Did not notice dark or bloody stools until 
arriving to the hospital. No nausea or vomiting and was 
protecting his airway adequately during his hospitalization. 
Given at least 9uPRBC at the outside hospital prior to arrival 
here.  Was given a total of 13uPRBC during his hospitalization 
here, as well as 9u platelets and 9uFFP.  Started on IV 
pantoprazole BID and aminocaproic acid.  Underwent upper 
endoscopy with GI early in his hospital course, for which he was 
intubated.  Upper endoscopy showed old blood in stomach but 
otherwise no acute bleeding source. ___ team took patient down 
for angiography and found no obvious target of bleeding, which 
initially showed no area of active extravasation.  Blood volume 
continued to remain unstable.  

On ___ Pt went again to ___ and underwent a L gastric artery 
embolization.  His bleeding slowed, but he continued to require 
blood transfusions as above.  Subsequent upper endoscopy on 
___ notable for ischemic gastric mucosa.  Pt developed a 
two-pressor requirement (norepinephrine and vasopressin).  He 
was placed on octreotide and desmopressin for splanchnic 
vasoconstriction and improvement of uremic platelet dysfunction 
(see below), respectively.  Per discussion with family, Pt was 
made DNR/DNI and transitioned to comfort-focused care on 
___.  Pt was extubated and passed away on ___.  

#HFrEF:  EF ___ in ___. CVO2 51 and lactate 2.8 on 
admission, likely a combination of severe anemia and borderline 
shock. On clinical examination, appears euvolemic and not in 
acute heart failure.  Initially held his torsemide, metoprolol, 
digoxin, lisinopril and tamsulosin in setting of low BPs and 
___.  
Had fluid overload in setting of multiple blood transfusions, 
which was tolerated due to need to maintain stable blood volume.

#Altered mental status:  Pt was initially sedated for his 
intubation with propofol and pain controlled with fentanyl.  
Taken off propofol on ___ but continued to remain 
unresponsive and unable to follow commands.  CT head on ___ 
demonstrated bilateral cerebellar hemispheric hypodensities, 
concerning for infarct though time course indeterminate.  Amicar 
discontinued in the setting of possible ischemic event.  

#Atrial fibrillation with RVR: INR goal ___ given frequent 
episodes of supratherapeutic INR. On warfarin, supratherapeutic 
INR of 3.6 on initial presentation to OSH.  Reversed at OSH with 
INR 1.4 upon arrival to ___. Warfarin and metoprolol were held 
in setting of active GI bleed and low BPs. 

#Thrombocytopenia:  Dilutional and active consumption of 
platelets likely etiologies. Required frequent transfusions of 
platelets as above to prevent further dilutional 
thrombocytopenia.  Started on desmopressin given rising uremia 
in setting of acute-on-chronic kidney injury to improve platelet 
dysfunction.

#ANION GAP and NON-GAP METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Downtrending bicarb 
in setting of shock + CKD; Lactate initially increased (2.8 on 
admission, to a peak of 3.2) but normalized. Diabetes reasonably 
well controlled. Possible contributors included renal failure, 
hyperchloremia, plus ongoing bloody output from rectal tube.

#HYPERNATREMIA:  Given D5 to replete free water deficit.

#IDDM: Home levemir + novolog. Started on lantus sliding scale 
during hospitalization. 

#ACUTE ON CKD STAGE III-IV: Cr 2.6 on admission with baseline 
around 1.6. Likely prerenal given low BPs and active bleeding. 
Has received volume back with blood and platelet transfusion, 
but with persistent fluid overload in setting of holding 
diuretics.  Creatinine trended up to a peak of 4.3.

1. A peg tube in appropriate location within the body of 
stomach.  No 
significant intra-abdominal pathology. 

___ Imaging CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST 
IMPRESSION:  
No acute intracranial process.  No evidence of intracranial 
hemorrhage. 
Possible acute sinusitis as described above. 

___ Imaging CHEST (PORTABLE AP 
FINDINGS:  
Tracheostomy is in place.  Right internal jugular catheter 
probably terminates where brachiocephalic veins meet to form the 
superior vena cava.  Gastrostomy is not visualized, probably not 
within the field of view.  Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar 
contours appear stable.  Chest is hyperinflated.  There is no 
pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Lungs appear clear. 

___ Cardiovascular Transthoracic Echo Report 
The visually estimated left ventricular ejection fraction is 
>=75%.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal left ventricular 
wall thickness and cavity size and
regional systolic function. Global function is hyperdynamic. No 
valvular pathology or pathologic
flow identified.

___ Imaging CTA CHEST AND CT ABDOMEN
IMPRESSION:    
No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic abnormality. 
There is suggestion of right bronchomalacia in the current CT 
scan with 
complete collapse of the right main bronchus.  Additionally 
bronchial wall 
inflammation is noted in both lower lobes with a new area of 
mucoid plugging to the right associated to small postobstructive 
atelectasis. 

___ Imaging CHEST (PORTABLE AP)   
FINDINGS:  
The lungs are clear without consolidation, effusion, or edema.  
The 
cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  No acute 
osseous 
abnormalities.","Mr. ___ is a ___ with a history of COPD and HTN, recent 
admission to ___ for hypercarbic respiratory failure from COPD 
exacerbation, presenting with dyspnea with hypercarbic 
respiratory failure secondary to COPD exacerbation, now s/p 
prolonged intubation and trach/PEG placement ___. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
# Prednisone 
[ ] Discharged on prednisone 10 mg daily. Please continue to 
wean as tolerated and consider PCP prophylaxis if difficult to 
wean.
[ ] High risk for adrenal insufficiency, has been on pred taper 
here and is at potential to be symptomatic

# Hypernatremia
[ ] Please give free water flushes 200ml q4hr. Patient could not 
get D5W at discharge given IV access lost

# Constipation
[ ] Continue aggressive bowel regimen including 
methylnaltrexone, and consider KUB if patient does not have 
bowel movement soon after arrival

# Low TSH
[ ] Recheck TSH, free T4 in 6 weeks as outpatient. TSH was found 
to be low at 0.13, likely reflecting sick euthyroid thyroid in 
the setting of critical illness.

# Methadone
[ ] Discharged on 10mg q6hrs, please continue for 2 days, then 
wean to 10mg q8 hours for 2 days, and then 10mg q12hrs for 2 
days, and then stop. 
[ ] Get ECG for QTc monitoring every other day while on 
methadone

# Seroquel
[ ] Wean as tolerated 

ACUTE ISSUES 
============ 
#Hypercarbic respiratory failure
#Refractory COPD exacerbation
The patient presented with refractory hypercarbia requiring 
intubation. He was initially extubated ___, but required 
reintubation that day for agitation/hypercarbia. He then 
underwent prolonged intubation for ongoing hypercarbic 
respiratory failure and high peak pressures. He received 
standing nebs, azithromycin, and multiple trials of high-dose 
steroids which were ultimately tapered to pred 10mg qd before 
discharge. The patient required heavy sedation with propofol and 
fentanyl as well as ketamine given low blood pressures. He 
received paralytics to achieve synchronization with the vent. 
Additionally he was given IV lasix boluses prn to keep his lungs 
clear from edema. His presentation was unusually severe for a 
COPD exacerbation and may have been partially due to overlying 
viral bronchiolitis or asthma leading to increased airway 
resistance. His course was additionally complicated by MSSA VAP 
(s/p 9 days cefepime transitioned to cefazolin). Despite vent 
adjustment to improve autoPEEP and I/E ratio, the patient 
required chronic intubation and was transitioned to trach on 
___. He was still vent dependent transitioned to pressure 
support before discharge. 

#Encephalopathy
After weaning sedation, the patient was transitioned to 
methadone, dilaudid, Seroquel due to concern with potential 
opioid withdrawal after prolonged course of fentanyl drip during 
intubation. He remained somnolent after this transition which 
was thought most likely to be iatrogenic from the opioids and 
Seroquel. CT head was negative. Dilaudid drip was stopped, 
methadone was spaced to q6hr, Seroquel was changed to qhs before 
discharge.

#Hypotension
The patient was started on norepinephrine drip for hypotension, 
thought to be due to vasodilatory effects from the sedatives 
possibly with a component of systemic inflammation from his 
acute respiratory failure and acidosis.

#Anemia of chronic disease 
His hemoglobin had decreased to ___ from ___ earlier in 
his hospitalization. His anemia was consistent with anemia of 
chronic disease, likely due to systemic inflammation resulting 
in decreased bone marrow function and decreased production of 
RBCs. With increasing macrocytosis, likely representing 
nutritional deficiency versus reticulocyte response.

#Fevers
#Acute sinusitis
During his second intubation, the patient developed fevers and 
was treated with cefazolin x 7 days for MSSA VAP. Despite 
appropriate treatment for MSSA with cefazolin, patient continued 
to spike fevers and was broadened to cefepime. He was found to 
have acute sinusitis on CT Head/sinus ___ and started on Unasyn 
with improvement in fevers, transitioned to PO augmentin before 
discharge. Other than positive sputum culture with MSSA and 
respiratory cultures showing yeast, cultures remained with no 
growth to date upon discharge. 

#Constipation 
CT A/P with significant stool burden. Patient was given standing 
bowel reg including PR bisacodyl and methylnaltrexone for 
prolonged opioid course.

# Code Status: Full confirmed 
# Emergency Contact: HCP ___, Sister ___

#Pericardial effusion now s/p pericardiocentesis - Etiology of 
effusion unclear at this point, multiple studies pending from ___ 
___ as well as ___ at time of discharge. DDx included 
post-viral, which seemed most likely given recent viral symptoms 
but could also be related to other infectious etiologies vs. 
rheumatologic process vs. thyroid dysfunction (although TSH nl) 
given history vs. malignancy. Patient was placed on NC O2 for 
comfort but ambulated with SPO2 92% at discharge.

#Sinus tachycardia - persistent after pericardiocentesis, likely 
due to residual pericardial fluid vs. potentially hypovolemia, 
no other clear signs of infection prior to discharge, improved 
with 500cc of normal saline, but was still persistent at 
discharge.

___ URINE URINE CULTURE-FINAL no growth","Ms. ___ is a an ___ year old woman with atrial fibrillation 
(on warfarin), DM2, HTN, HL who initially presented to ___ 
___ for fatigue, weakness, and poor PO intake and was found 
to have hyponatremia to 115. She did not have any other 
complaints at the time, no SOB, CP, cough, dysuria, urinary 
frequency, or rashes.  She did have some nausea, vomiting and 
mild diarrhea approximately one week prior to admission and her 
appetite has decreased since that time.  ED vitals were normal 
(147/70, 88, 18, 100%RA) and she was given 1.5L NS bolus and 
sodium bumped to 125.  Later it fell again to 115 on ___, but 
on arrival to ___, Na was 125 and her only complaint was 
fatigue.  
 
# Hyponatremia: Likely hypovolemic given decreased PO intake 
over last several weeks and patient appears dry on exam. Na of 
125 to 115 within one day suggests that this is an acute on 
chronic issue.  Urine lytes were sent, but not instructive given 
that the patient has been on large amounts of IV fluids. Sodium 
level is fluid responsive. AM cortisol and TSH sent as well in 
search for possible secondary cause, though both returned within 
normal limits.  Patient started on 100cc/hr maintenance fluids 
with NS boluses and demonstrated steady improvement in Na. She 
remained asymptomatic throughout except for some mild subjective 
difficulty concentrating. On discharge patients sodium level 
held steady at > 130 after drinking to thirst off of IV fluid 
hydration.  She should follow up with PCP for strategies to 
encorage adequate PO intake as her hyponatremia is most likely 
secondary to hypovolemia.  
 
# Atrial Fibrillation: She arrived with a supratherapeutic INR 
of 4.1 and her home coumadin dose was held for 1 day and her INR 
fell to 1.9 at which point her anticoagulation was resumed at 
home doses (5mg, then 5mg, then 2.5 mg, then repeat).  She 
should follow up with the ___ clinic to optimize 
dosing. She was also continued on her home dose of atenolol with 
good rate control.
 
# Hypertension: Slightly elevated blood pressures throughout 
hospitalization (SBP 140s-160s).  Patient was continued on home 
dose of moexipril, but should follow up with PCP to optimize 
___ regimen.  Given tendency toward volume 
depletion, may consider non-diuretics.  
  
# Type 2 DM: Patient's home glipizide and metformin were held 
during the hospitalization and she was put on a humalog insulin 
sliding scale with finger sticks ranging from 140s-150s. Home

CHEST X-RAY, TWO VIEWS, ___ 
HISTORY:  ___ male with elevated troponins and shortness 
of breath. 
FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest are compared to 
study performed at ___ from earlier the same day.  There has 
been interval development of indistinct pulmonary vascular 
markings.  Small- to moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions 
are more clearly delineated on the current exam.  The lung 
volumes are seen.  Cardiac silhouette is prominent, likely 
accentuated due to AP technique and low inspiratory effort.  
Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable. 
IMPRESSION:  Findings suggestive of congestive failure and 
moderate bilateral effusions. 
.
PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY OF ___. 
COMPARISON:  Radiograph ___. 
FINDINGS:  Persistent cardiomegaly with improved pulmonary 
vascular congestion but persistent moderate right and small left 
pleural effusion with adjacent basilar atelectasis and/or 
consolidation.  Diffuse haziness in upper abdomen suggest the 
possibility of ascites. 
.
RENAL U/S ___:
INDICATION:  Assess for hydronephrosis and clot burden in the 
bladder. 
COMPARISONS:  CT abdomen and pelvis from ___. 
RENAL ULTRASOUND:  Assessment of the kidneys is somewhat limited 
due to body habitus and overlying bowel gas.  The right kidney 
measures 9.5 cm.  The left kidney was not as well seen, 
measuring 9.6 cm.  No definite hydronephrosis is seen 
bilaterally.  The bladder is decompressed with a Foley catheter 
with a 4.4 x 3.8 cm avascular lesion within the bladder. 
IMPRESSION:  No definite hydronephrosis on this limited study 
with 4.4-cm avascular echogenbic lesion in the bladder. This 
could reflect clot given the history though a mass is not 
excluded. Consider contrast enhanced CT or direct visualization. 
 
.
B/L LENIs ___:
INDICATION:  ___ male with new right bundle-branch 
block, concern for PE, but unable to get CTA.  Assess for DVT. 
COMPARISONS:  None. 
Grayscale and color Doppler sonographic evaluation was performed 
of the bilateral lower extremities.  Normal compressibility and 
flow was seen in the bilateral common femoral, superficial 
femoral, popliteal, peroneal, and posterior tibial veins without 
evidence of DVT. Mild left sided subcutaneous edema noted. 
IMPRESSION:  No lower extremity DVT. 
.
Echo ___: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left 
atrium is elongated. There is moderate symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is 
unusually small. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal 
wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left 
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is no 
ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is 
mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The 
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are 
normal. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be 
determined. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. 
Significant aortic stenosis is present (not quantified). No 
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. Mild to moderate (___) mitral regurgitation 
is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. 
There is a small pericardial effusion. The effusion appears 
circumferential. There are no echocardiographic signs of 
tamponade. 
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Preserved left ventricular 
global systolic function with moderate, symmetric LVH. Aortic 
stenosis is present but unable to quantify. Mild to moderate MR. 
___ RV is mildly dilated and hypokinetic. Small, circumferential 
pericardial effusion with no echocardiographic signs of

You were admitted to the hospital with shortness of breath.  You 
had fluid in your lungs, which may have contributed to the 
shortness of breath.  This fluid in your lungs may have been due 
to a heart attack, heart failure, a blood clot in your lungs, or 
a combination of these issues.  It is very likely that you had a 
blood clot in your lungs, but we did not do the CT test to 
confirm this, given that it would likely further harm your 
kidneys.  We also did not treat you for this blood clot, given 
that the treatment would increase your risk of having blood in 
your urine and increase the risk of you dying from a bleed in 
your gastrointestinal tract or head, especially if you were to 
fall.  Your family agreed with this plan.

We gave you Lasix (a diuretic) to decrease the fluid around your 
lungs.  After we did this, your breathing improved.  

For your heart, we gave you aspirin (an increased dose compared 
to what you used to take), metoprolol (a beta-blocker, which 
decreases the work that your heart has does when pumping blood), 
and atorvastatin (which decreases cholesterol plaque formation 
in your arteries).  

You also had blood in your urine, which may have been coming 
from your prostate or your bladder.  We transfused you with red 
blood cells in order to increase your red blood cell level.  The 
bleeding stabilized.  Please follow up with urology at the

# POSSIBLE PULMONARY EMBOLISM: Patient presented with shortness 
of breath, RBBB, tachypnea to ___ ___nd troponin leak. 
 While these symptoms might be c/w other etiologies such as 
heart failure and myocardial ischemia/infarction, they were also 
very concerning for PE.  In terms of PE risk, patient has factor 
V Leiden but no hx clot.  PE strongly considered in pt with 
right heart strain, elevated troponins, signs of right heart 
failure more than left heart failure. Has renal failure so 
unlikely to tolerate CTA.  V/Q scan unlikely to be useful given 
the underlying pulmonary edema.  LENIs were negative.  The 
medical team had a long conversation with the family about goals 
of care and about the possible PE in particular.  The family 
understood that their father might have a PE and that the PE 
could kill him if untreated.  However, anticoagulating the 
patient with heparin (and later with warfarin) would have 
worsened his hematuria.  Given his age, fall risk, and the goals 
of care, we recommended not treating the patient.  The family 
understood the situation and the risks and did not want to 
pursue CTA or empiric anticoagulation.  The patient did receive 
heparin subQ.
.
# NSTEMI / DEMAND ISCHEMIA: Patient presented with troponin leak 
(peaked at 1.55) and ST changes difficult to interpret in the 
setting of RBBB, which was found to be pre-existing at least 
since ___.  Catheterization not c/w patient's goals of 
care.  Heparin gtt also not in line with goals of care and would 
risk worsening hematuria. We treated the patient with aspirin 
325mg daily, atorvastatin 80mg daily, and metoprolol 12.5mg QID 
(he was eventually transitioned to metoprolol XL 25mg, a lower 
total dose due to heart rates in the ___ when getting 50mg total 
daily).  On ___, we tranfused 2 units blood for dropping HCT 
(to 25.5) and active GU bleeding in the setting of NSTEMI/demand 
ischemia.  The patient denied chest pain, and his troponin 
trended down.  
.
# HEMATURIA: ___ be due to prostate CA or treatment or bladder 
CA or treatment.  Renal U/S did reveal a lesion in the bladder 
(clot vs. mass).  Urology was consulted, and they recommended 
putting in a large-bore Foley to tamponade possible prostatic 
bleeding and to start finasteride 5mg daily.  Finasteride was 
started.  A ___ catheter was placed, but was removed ___ 
when he appeared to be obstructed.  He continued to pass blood 
and clots in his urine until ___ when the urine was clear.  He 
did have to be straight cathed on ___ for obstruction, and we 
continued to monitor him with bladder scans.  As above, he was 
transfused on ___.  We spoke with radiation oncology about the 
possibility of palliative radiation to stop bleeding.  They 
would need to do preferably a cystoscopy (family did not want to 
pursue this due to risk of anesthesia in their father) or a CT 
w/ contrast (which we and the family did not want to pursue 
given the kidney disease).  CT without contrast might localize 
source of bleeding enough to plan pelvic XRT.  Son wanted to 
consider pursuing this if bleeding worsened and after meeting 
with urology for outpatient follow up.  After transfusion on 
___, HCT remained stable around ~33.
.
# ___ (on CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE STAGE III): Chronic kidney 
disease likely from DMII, unknown baseline, but appears to be in 
range of 1.6-1.8 base on records from ___. 
 Patient presented with creatinine of 1.6, which increased to 
2.2 with aggressive diuresis.  Acute injury likely from prerenal 
(acute heart failure vs. over-diuresis) vs. obstruction (CA/mass 
vs. clot).  Obstruction was thought to be less likely given no 
obvious hydro on renal u/s.  Most likely prerenal is setting of 
over-diuresis.  Creatinine stabilized in range of ~1.7-1.8.
.
# DMII: On oral hypoglycemics at home.  Patient was put on 
insulin sliding scale while here.
.
# GOALS OF CARE: Patient was DNR/DNI at baseline.  On ___, the 
medicine team, along with palliative care, met with the 
son/POA/HCP ___ and the pt's daughter ___ to discuss goals 
of care.  We agreed not to further pursue diagnosis or treatment 
of PE, given the patient's c/i to IV contrast and given that we 
would not want to treat him right now because of his stable 
respiratory status, his GU bleeding, and his high fall risk.  
___ and ___ are sure that they would like their father to go 
back to ___, the ___, and not to go to a nursing home/SNF, or 
if he has to go, to go only temporarily.  We discussed the 
option of ""do not hospitalize,"" but the family did not seem 
ready to make that decision.  We did, however, discuss hospice, 
and the son spoke to case management to see if the patient meets 
criteria.  I spoke with the son again ___ about goals of care. 
 In addition to reviewing what we talked about at the family 
meeting on the day prior, we also talked about the option of 
""allowing natural death"" and not transfusing blood if he were to 
have increased bleeding from his GU tract.  Son expressed that 
to him and his sister, this would feel too much like ""pulling 
the plug.""  They are not ready to have their father be ""do not 
hospitalize"" or ""allow natural death,"" but they are aware that 
these options exist for the future.  Case management spoke to 
the family about hospice, and they would like to continue 
exploring this as an option for the future.
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Patient's family would like to get their father back to ___ 
(assisted living) as soon as possible, but understands he will 
have to go to a SNF first.
- Patient's family may consider do not hospitalize (___) and/or 
hospice in the future. 
- Urology follow-up is scheduled for early ___."

obesity who presents as a transfer from ___ 
___ for management of acute systolic heart failure. She was 
in her normal state of health as recently as one week prior to 
her ___ admission (walking multiple hours a day). On 
___ she developed shortness of breath, and within several days 
had significant lower extremity edema and inability to walk even 
a few feet. She was diuresed at ___ and at ___ with 
significant symptomatic improvement. Given that a coronary 
angiography did not demonstrate occlusive disease, we conducted 
a thorough workup for heart failure etiology.

ACUTE MEDICAL ISSUES
====================
# CORONARIES: mid LAD 60% stenosis, lesion on mid CX 30% 
stenosis; lesion on mid RCA 50% stenosis; lesion on R PDA 90% 
stenosis 
# PUMP: LVEF 34% with RWMA, dilated LV chamber; LAE; 2 to 3+ MR; 
2+ TR est SPAP 31 mmhg
# RHYTHM: Sinus 

#Acute Heart Failure with Reduced EF (20%)
Patient presents with several months of cough and two weeks of 
lower extremity swelling with acute hypoxic respiratory failure 
after CTA. Found to have LVEF 20% with LV dilation, ___, 
2+TR. No evidence of obstructive coronary disease, but did have 
regional wall motion abnormalities on ___ Echo. Repeat 
TTE again at ___ showed: Severe global left ventricular 
systolic dysfunction with relative apical and lateral wall 
preservation suggestive of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. 
Depressed global right ventricular systolic function. Moderate 
mitral regurgitation."" Cardiac MRI: ""Overall findings are most 
consistent with mixed ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathy."" 
Does have history of recent recurrent viral infections, so it is 
possible that a viral myocarditis was missed. Possible she's had 
prior MI with 90% PDA occlusion, though less likely that 
inflammatory of infiltrative cardiomyopathy. She also has a 
history of sinus tachycardia and was borderline tachycardia 
throughout her admission, again raising concern for inflammatory 
cardiomyopathy. She was treated with IV Lasix at ___ and 
initially at ___, then with torsemide 20mg and eventually 
torsemide 10mg, on which she was mildly net negative to even. 
- Preload: Torsemide 10mg daily to be continued at discharge
- Afterload: Valsartan 80mg daily to be continued at discharge 
(new)
- NHB: Metop succinate 75mg (to help with tachycardia)

#Hypertension
Had recently been on lisinopril and atenolol as an outpatient, 
but these had recently been held. She was treated with 
lisinopril and metoprolol at ___, but we stopped 
lisinopril out of concern it may be contributing to her chronic 
cough. Valsartan 80mg daily and metop succinate 75mg daily at 
discharge 

#Chronic cough
Persistent dry cough since her first viral illness in ___. Somewhat improved during her hospitalization. Seen by 
pulmonology here with unremarkable PFTs. Stopped her ACEi and 
started on omeprazole for trial of PPI at this admission. 

#Hyperlipidemia
Atorvastatin 20mg QHS was increased to 80mg. Continued on ASA 
81. 

#Type 2 DM
On lantus 25units BID and metformin 850mg TID. Held metformin in 
setting of CTA at OSH and put on sliding scale. Metformin 
restarted prior to discharge.

You came into the hospital because you were having shortness of 
breath and swelling in your legs. 

At ___, you were found to have blockages in your heart; 
it did not seem like these were new or causing a new heart 
attack, but they may have been there for a while and contributed 
to your shortness of breath.

You were found to have new heart failure, which means the heart 
is not pumping as well as it should be. This is what caused your 
body to accumulate fluid. You were given IV diuretics. You were 
transferred to ___ to be evaluated by our Heart Failure team.

We did a lot of tests, including an echocardiogram (heart 
ultrasound), a heart MRI, and a stress test. We did all of this 
to find out what caused your heart failure.

These tests showed that it is probably blockages in the arteries 
(atherosclerosis/plaques or heart attacks) that caused your 
heart failure. The MRI that we did showed that there may be 
possibly another reason (such as inflammation from a virus in 
the past) that also may have contributed to your heart failure.

WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN I LEAVE THE HOSPITAL
===========================================
Please take all of your medications as prescribed.

Please keep all follow-up appointments that we have made for 
you.

CULTURE and PATHOLOGY:
.
Renal Biopsy ___: Renal biopsy, needle:  Pauci-immune 
crescentic glomerulonephritis in the setting of P-ANCA 
positivity.
-Light Microscopy: The specimen consists of renal cortex, 
containing approximately 15 glomeruli, of which 4 are globally 
sclerotic.  The remainder show up to mild mesangial prominence.  
About 6 show segmental necrosis and/or fibrocellular crescents.  
About 3 show segmental sclerosis.
There is patchy mild moderate interstitial fibrosis and tubular 
atrophy.  Chronic inflammation accompanies the scarring.  Intact 
tubulo-interstitium shows mild chronic inflammation and acute 
tubular injury.  No tubulocystic change is noted. Arteries show 
mild-moderate intimal fibroplasia.
Arterioles show mild-moderate mural thickening, with some 
hyaline change.
No vasculitis is noted.
-Immunofluorescence:  The specimen consists of renal cortex, 
containing approximately 6 glomeruli, of which 1 is globally 
sclerotic.  There is no staining for IgG, IgA, IgM, C3, Kappa, 
Lambda, and C1q.  Three glomeruli show segmental fibrin 
positivity.
Albumin is non-contributory.
-Comment:
1.  The segmental sclerosis raises the possibility of prior 
necrotizing lesions.
2.  There is some degree of tubulo-interstitial scarring.  A 
component of chronic lithium toxicity cannot be excluded.

.","This is a ___ year old male with newly diagnosed pANCA-positive 
rapid progressive glomerulonephritis thought to be due to 
allopurinol who was admitted here for further work-up and 
treatment and whose course was complicated by multifactorial 
toxic metabolic encephalopathy.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES BY PROBLEM:
# Rapid Progressive Glomerulonephritis (RPGN)- Patient's 
creatinine was noted to be rapidly rising in the past several 
months. Patient seen by ___ nephrologist who sent 
pANCA test which came back positive with high titers. Patient 
was directly admitted here for treatment and further work-up. 
Work-up including ___, hepatitis screen, cryoglobulins, and 
anti-GBM were negative. Patient's complement levels were 
slightly elevated. Renal biopsy on ___ showed atypical pANCA 
staning, anti-MPO positive pauci-immune disease with some 
crescents.  Also with some signs of fibrosis that were likely 
related to patient's chronic lithium use.  Patient was started 
on cyclophosphamide and daily prednisone.  Patient's allopurinol 
was held given its potential association with high-titer 
atypical p-ANCA RPGN.  Patient's creatinine peaked at 3.1 but 
trended down to 1.6 by the time of discharge. Patient was 
discharged on a daily dose of 60mg prednisone and 125mg cytoxan 
to be further titrated by his outpatient nephrologist.  Patient 
was started on PCP prophylaxis given newly immunosuppressed 
state, H2 blocker and vitamin D.
.
# Toxic Metabolic Encephalopathy - On admission, patient 
demonstrated mental slowing,  profound inattention, and 
significant upper extremity tremors. His MMSE was ___. His 
lithium level was found to be critically elevated to 2.8, likely 
because patient's renal function had rapidly declined without a 
concurrent change in his lithium dosing.  Lithium levels were 
<0.3 before discharge. Other factors that contributed to 
patient's confusion included the initiation of high-dose 
steroids, hyperglycemia (related to the steroids), 
hypercalcemia, hypernatremia, and patient's underlying bipolar 
disorder. Patient was started on risperidal to correct his 
delirium and impulsive behavior, but this was discontinued by 
the time of discharge as patient's metabolic abnormalities 
corrected and his mental status cleared. By discharge, patient's 
mental status had returned to his baseline. MMSE on discharge 
was ___.  Lithium was held per below.
.
# Hypotension - On hospital day 10, patient triggered for 
lethargy, unusual posturing and hypotension with a systolic 
blood pressure in the ___. Head CT was ordered which showed no 
abnormalities and Neuro was consulted who suggested patient 
might have had an unwitnessed seizure in the setting of his 
hypernatremia. Patient's blood pressures improved with 
aggressive fluid resuscitation and he became much more alert as 
the day progressed. The patient triggered again two days later 
for a similar presentation.  Cultures, chest x-ray, and EKG were 
obtained, all of which were normal. ABG initially showed 
elevated lactate, but this resolved with fluid resuscitation. 
Patient had just received his morning risperidal dose so it was 
thought there might be a link between the early morning 
hypotension and the administration of this drug. Also, 
cinacalcet had recently been started which sometimes results in 
hypotension. Both of these medications were discontinued.  To 
evaluate for adrenal insufficiency, a random AM cortisol was 
obtained and followed by a cosyntropin stimulation test which 
did not show adrenal insufficency.  Though patient continued to 
have blood pressures in the low 100s, he did not have any more 
repeat episodes of severe hypotension and his infectious work-up 
remained negative.  Given his episodic hypotension, his home 
propranolol (prescribed for essential tremor not blood pressure) 
dose was halved.
.
# Hypernatremia - Patient became very hypernatremic on hospital 
day ___ after initial fluid resuscitation with normal saline had 
been decreased, with a peak sodium of 158. Patient required 
several days of continuous replacement with D5W in order to 
maintain his sodium at a normal level. Patient's urine osms were 
noted to be quite low, suggesting patient has an element of 
diabetes insipidus, likely due to his chronic lithium use. 
Patient states that he normally feels thirsty and urinates quite 
frequently normally at home, but during the hospitalization, 
patient's delirium often necessitated chemical and/or physical 
restraints at night, making it impossible for patient to replete 
himself with free water as he would normally be able to at home. 
As patient's mental status cleared, he was able to be weaned off 
continuous D5W and was able to replete his own free water 
deficit by increasing his intake of free water to match his 
output. In order to decrease patient's urine output and the 
effects of his diabetes insipidus, patient was started on a 
thiazide diuretic and a low sodium diet.
.
# Hypercalcemia - Patient was found to have a very elevated 
calcium on admission with a peak value of 12.7. Patient was 
aggressively hydrated, first with normal saline and then with 
D5W when patient developed hypernatremia. Patient's parathyroid 
hormone (PTH) levels were also noted to be quite elevated, 
originally 99 at his nephrologist's office and peaking at 215 in 
the hospital. Thought to be related to lithium toxicity, as 
lithium is associated with transiently elevated PTH and 
subsequent hypercalcemia. Lithium can also predispose to the 
formation of parathyroid adenomas. Finally, could also be 
secondary in the setting of renal failure. Patient trialed on 
cinacalcet with no improvement in his PTH. By the time of 
discharge, patient's PTH and calcium were downtrending, however, 
patient should consider outpatient evaluation of possible 
parathyroid adenoma as cause for his persistently elevated PTH. 
.
# Bipolar disorder - Patient had been well-controlled on high 
dose lithium for ___ years but lithium had to be held in the 
setting of toxic levels on admission and given pt's kidney 
disease, this was no longer a safe medication for patient to 
take.  Patient and his family members have a history of 
difficult to control bipolar disease that does not respond to 
depakote. Psychiatry was consulted who recommended lamictal 25mg 
daily. They plan to increase dose of Lamictal to 50mg daily on 
___. Patient will need close follow-up with his outpatient 
provider ___ to find an appropriate regimen that he can 
be stabilized on. This is especially important as patient will 
be on high-dose steroids which have the potential to exacerbate 
his underlying manic tendencies. Patient's altered mental status 
during admission was thought to be mostly secondary to delirium, 
not early manifestations of his underlying bipolar.  
.
# Hyperglycemia - Patient became quite hyperglycemic once 
started on high dose steroids. He has no history of DM so he was 
maintained on an insulin sliding scale while in the hospital. On 
discharge, he was set up with visiting nurse services, who will 
continue to assist him with blood glucose control. 
.
CHRONIC ISSUES BY PROBLEM:
# Gout: Last attack was several years ago. Patient currently 
asymptomatic, however, his allopurinol will be stopped 
indefinitely since this might be a cause of his RPGN. As patient 
will be on high dose steroids he will likely not require any 
further treatment. However, the patient does have high serum 
levels of uric acid and may benefit from prophylaxis after 
finishing steroid therapy. PCP has been notified and will","Allopurinol ___ mg Oral Tablet 1 tablet daily

You were admitted to the hospital with abdominal pain and found 
to have an infection in your appendix. You were taken to the 
operating room and had your appendix removed laparoscopically. 
You tolerated the procedure well and are now being discharged 
home to continue your recovery with the following instructions.
 
Please follow up in the Acute Care Surgery clinic at the 
appointment listed below.
 
ACTIVITY:
 
o Do not drive until you have stopped taking pain medicine and 
feel you could respond in an emergency.
o You may climb stairs. 
o  You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until 
you see your surgeon at your next visit.
o  Don't lift more than ___ lbs for 4 weeks. (This is about 
the weight of a briefcase or a bag of groceries.) This applies 
to lifting children, but they may sit on your lap.
o You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable.
o You will need to stay out of bathtubs or swimming pools for a 
time while your incision is healing. Ask your doctor when you 
can resume tub baths or swimming.
 
HOW YOU MAY FEEL: 
o  You may feel weak or ""washed out"" for a couple of weeks. You 
might want to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you.
o  You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your 
throat during surgery.
o  You might have trouble concentrating or difficulty sleeping. 
You might feel somewhat depressed.
o  You could have a poor appetite for a while. Food may seem 
unappealing.
o  All of these feelings and reactions are normal and should go 
away in a short time.  If they do not, tell your surgeon.
 
YOUR INCISION:
o Tomorrow you may shower and remove the gauzes over your 
incisions. Under these dressing you have small plastic bandages 
called steri-strips. Do not remove steri-strips for 2 weeks. 
(These are the thin paper strips that might be on your 
incision.) But if they fall off before that that's okay).
o Your incisions may be slightly red around the stitches. This 
is normal.
o You may gently wash away dried material around your incision.
o Avoid direct sun exposure to the incision area.
o Do not use any ointments on the incision unless you were told 
otherwise.
o You may see a small amount of clear or light red fluid 
staining your dressing or clothes. If the staining is severe, 
please call your surgeon.
o You may shower. As noted above, ask your doctor when you may 
resume tub baths or swimming.
 
YOUR BOWELS:

mouth. It is important to take this medicine as directed. o Do 
not take it more frequently than prescribed. Do not take more 
medicine at one time than prescribed.
o Your pain medicine will work better if you take it before your 
pain gets too severe.

prescription pain medicine. Please don't take any other pain 
medicine, including non-prescription pain medicine, unless your 
surgeon has said its okay.

    cm2 advancement flap closure.
2. Right axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy.","Dr. ___ is a physician and states that he became aware 
of a pigmented lesion of the right upper back in ___.  He does not know whether
it could have been there earlier.  He denied pruritus or any 
type of spontaneous bleeding.  Unfortunately, ___ was 
hospitalized at the ___ recently for 
alcohol withdrawal.  At that time, the pigmented lesion was 
identified.  It is unclear to me if he actually
underwent a complete skin examination while an inpatient.

On ___, a shave biopsy was performed.  The initial
pathology from ___ indicated that he had an 
invasive
melanoma of a minimal depth of 1.5 mm with an involved deep
margin, extending to ___ level IV.  The report was equivocal
concerning ulceration or possible lymphovascular invasion.  
Seven
mitoses were present per mm2.  The lesion had both vertical and
radial growth phase.  There was no satellitosis, perineural
invasion, or significant regression.

The involved deep margin appears to be quite focal and most 
likely
the depth is as reported.   There was extensive juxta-vascular
disease, which overall should most likely be interpreted as
representing lymphovascular invasion.  Nine mitoses were present
per mm2.  Accordingly, ___ final tumor staging would be T2b.","Aside from his issues with alcohol, ___ has no other medical
problems.  Apparently, his platelet count during his recent
admission was 100,000.  He states that he underwent an abdominal
ultrasound, which did not show an enlarged spleen and apparently
there was no ascites.  He denied ever having an upper
gastrointestinal hemorrhage or any elevation of his hepatic
enzymes.  I will plan to repeat basic laboratory examinations in
this regard today.  I believe that in year ___ he suffered the
delirium tremens with a seizure and had some degree of head
trauma.  He had no injury on cross-sectional imaging and has 
made
a complete recovery.  He denied any other seizures.  When I
inquired as to whether he was still drinking, my impression was
that he perhaps had only been abstinent for two days.

IMAGING:
CXR ___: 
Stable cardiomegaly and moderate pulmonary edema with a small 
right pleural 
effusion. A chest x-ray following diuresis is recommended 
  
CT head ___:
1. No significant interval change in bilateral subdural 
hematomas, as well as a rounded hemorrhagic focus within the 
right occipital lobe, which may also be extraaxial. 
2. Punctate foci of layering hemorrhage within the occipital 
horns of lateral ventricles, unchanged. 
3. No new hemorrhage identified 
  
CT C-spine ___: 
1. No fracture identified. 
2. Severe multilevel degenerative changes, with a grade 1 
anterolisthesis of C5 on 6, of indeterminate chronicity. 
However, clinical correlation is 
suggested. If there is a high clinical concern for ligamentous 
or cord 
injury, an MRI is suggested 
   
ECHO ___:
Mild left ventricular hypertrophy with mildly depressed global 
systolic function. Severe diastolic dysfunction. Severe aortic 
stenosis. Severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension
   
CT head ___:
1. No significant change in the subdural hemorrhages, noted, in 
the right 
frontal, right parietal and the left tentorial as well as along 
the 
cerebral convexity based on both sides compared to the most 
recent study.","Mr. ___ is an ___ yo male w/ PMHx sig for atrial fibrillation 
on
___ transferred from ___ with R frontal and 
temporal DHs and R occipital IPH in the setting of 
supratheraputic INR, thought to be related from unknown trauma 
vs hypertension.  

# Subdural hematomas: The patient was found to have R frontal 
and temporal subdurals and R occipital IPH in the setting of 
supratherapeutic INR.  This was reversed with Vitamin K and FFP. 
  He was followed by NS, who determined that no surgical 
intervention was needed at this time and recommended that Keppra 
be started for seizure prophylaxis.  They had initially 
recommended restarting ASA, but given the extent of his bleeds 
and discussion with his family, it was decided to hold 
anticoagulation until further evaluation with NSG in 1 month.  
The patient continued to have L sided weakness and L hemineglect 
on transfer to the floor, so Neurology was consulted. A repeat 
MRI revealed no evidence of acute infarct and stable size of his 
bleeds.  They felt that his bleeds could explain his previous 
hemineglect.  On repeat examination, Neurology felt his hemi 
neglect had and did not feel further intervention was needed.

He is scheduled for NSG follow up in 1 month with repeat CT 
scan.
    
# Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a h/o afib, for which he 
was on Coumadin and Toprol 25mg PO daily. He had an episode of 
afib with RVR on ___, which responded well to Diltiazem 
10mg IV. His Toprol dose was increased to 50mg PO daily with 
good effect. HR on discharge 88.

# UTI: The patient had a UCx that showed infection with 
Enterococcus. The patient was started on a 14 day course of 
Ampicillin. He has 10 days remaining in his course.
   
# Severe AS/Pulm HTN: The patient had an ECHO, which showed 
severe aortic stenosis with valve area 0.8-1.0 cm2 and severe 
pulm HTN. He will need close follow up by his outpatient

Humalog insulin pump (followed by Dr. ___ at ___, HTN, 
hypothyroid, and recent stroke 2 weeks ago without residual 
deficits who is admitted for DKA. 

#Diabetic Ketoacidosis
Mr. ___ presented in DKA with anion gap of 25, serum glucose 
of 425, elevated beta hydroxybuterate and a metabolic acidosis. 
He was initiated on an insulin infusion, normal saline boluses, 
and potassium and phosphate repletion. His gap rapidly closed 
and his beta hydroxy-buterate trended to zero. His acidosis also 
rapidly resolved. His insulin infusion was eventually weaned 
down per protocol and when it reached 4u/hour we initiated 
insulin subcutaneously with a initial basal dose of 28u 
glargine, standing humalog of 3u per meal and a sliding scale. 
He was able to eat at this time and he was then transferred to 
the floor. 

The etiology of his DKA was not immediately clear. He reports 
multiple prior episodes. CXR did not reveal pneumonia and a UA 
at an OSH did not show evidence of infection. His leukocytosis 
was thought to be reactive. There was concern that his insulin 
pump may have malfunctioned, though there was no clear evidence 
this was the case. ___ endocrinology was consulted. 

FLOOR COURSE:

# DKA now resolved: 
# Type I DM
Patient was continued on SC insulin at the time of transfer to 
the floor. Due to some issue with his insulin order, the patient 
did not receive his QHS glargine on the evening of ___. 
Subsequently had high BG readings the next AM w/ sugars in the 
400s. He received 28u of lantus and IVF w/ improvement in his 
sugars. He had his insulin adjusted by ___ and ___ be 
discharged with a regimen of #######. He will follow up with his 
endocrinologist, Dr. ___.

#Hx recent CVA
#Mild aphasia: Patient and his wife were concerned about him 
exhibiting word-finding difficulties (cardinal symptom noted 
during stroke a couple weeks ago) and some fine motor
difficulties (he was unable to write in his usual cursive and 
instead tried to write in print, unable to draw his wife a 
picture and per her is usually a great artist) at the time of 
his admission to the MICU. This was thought to be most likely 
recrudescence in the setting of his DKA as it improved w/ 
treatment of that condition. Patient notably with a recent CVA 
(2 weeks ago) during which ___ neuro noted reported ""L 
subcortical location and distribution of the stroke is most 
consistent with a small vessel occlusive mechanism."" Carotid U/S 
noting ""Bilateral carotid bulb and proximal ICA soft 
atherosclerotic plaque, left >right."" Carotid disease thought to 
be possibly the culprit though no residual disease which would 
be amenable to surgical intervention. TTE fairly unremarkable 
and w/o e/o intracardiac thrombi. Sent home w/ holter monitor 
(no results communicated to
patient yet). He reports history of intermittent ""fast heart 
rate"" but is not sure if it is a-fib and no documented history 
of this. Per ___ notes appears to be some unspecified SVT, w/
AVNRT noted on tele on the AM of ___. He was monitored for the 
rest of the admission and with no concern for new deficits which 
might suggest a CVA. He will be referred to neuro at the time of 
discharge.

#SVT
#Likely AVNRT: Patient w/ self-limited episodes of SVT which 
appeared to be AVNRT on the AM of ___. He was hemodynamically 
stable and asymptomatic. He reports having palpitations in the
past and having ""fast heart rates"" followed by Dr. ___. 
Notably not on any nodal blockade as an outpatient. He was 
started on a low dose of metoprolol, but was limited by 
bradycardia so he was not discharged on this. 

# Hypertension: SBP in the 200s overnight on ___ but 
reassuringly asymptomatic. He continued to have elevated BPs 
during this admission and so had his antihypertensive regimen 
titrated. He was on a regimen including an increased dose of 
lisinopril at the time of discharge. 

# Leukocytosis: Admitted w/ a WBC of 20K. Thought to be reactive 
in the setting of DKA. WBC downtrended over the course of the 
admission, and the patient had no localizing signs/symptoms of 
infection.

be in a dangerous condition called diabetic ketoacidosis.  

WHAT HAPPENED TO ME IN THE HOSPITAL?  
- You were admitted to the ICU where you were given insulin, 
fluid, and electrolytes. Your condition improved quite quickly.
- You were evaluated by the doctors from ___. Your insulin 
regimen was adjusted, and you will go out on injectable insulin 
instead of your insulin pump.
- You had elevated blood pressures and had your blood pressure 
medications increased. 

WHAT SHOULD I DO AFTER I LEAVE THE HOSPITAL?  
- Please take your medications and go to your follow up 
appointments as described in this discharge summary.  
- If you experience any of the danger signs listed below, please 
call your primary care doctor or go to the emergency department

We wish you the best!  
Sincerely,  
Your ___ Team","with his 
endocrinologist, Dr. ___.

#Hx recent CVA
#Mild aphasia: Patient and his wife were concerned about him 
exhibiting word-finding difficulties (cardinal symptom noted 
during stroke a couple weeks ago) and some fine motor
difficulties (he was unable to write in his usual cursive and 
instead tried to write in print, unable to draw his wife a 
picture and per her is usually a great artist) at the time of 
his admission to the MICU. This was thought to be most likely 
recrudescence in the setting of his DKA as it improved w/ 
treatment of that condition. Patient notably with a recent CVA 
(2 weeks ago) during which ___ neuro noted reported ""L 
subcortical location and distribution of the stroke is most 
consistent with a small vessel occlusive mechanism."" Carotid U/S 
noting ""Bilateral carotid bulb and proximal ICA soft 
atherosclerotic plaque, left >right."" Carotid disease thought to 
be possibly the culprit though no residual disease which would 
be amenable to surgical intervention. TTE fairly unremarkable 
and w/o e/o intracardiac thrombi. Sent home w/ holter monitor 
(no results communicated to
patient yet). He reports history of intermittent ""fast heart 
rate"" but is not sure if it is a-fib and no documented history 
of this. Per ___ notes appears to be some unspecified SVT, w/
AVNRT noted on tele on the AM of ___. He was monitored for the 
rest of the admission and with no concern for new deficits which 
might suggest a CVA. He will be referred to neuro at the time of 
discharge.

#SVT
#Likely AVNRT: Patient w/ self-limited episodes of SVT which 
appeared to be AVNRT on the AM of ___. He was hemodynamically 
stable and asymptomatic. He reports having palpitations in the
past and having ""fast heart rates"" followed by Dr. ___. 
Notably not on any nodal blockade as an outpatient. He was 
started on a low dose of metoprolol, but was limited by 
bradycardia so he was not discharged on this. 

# Hypertension: SBP in the 200s overnight on ___ but 
reassuringly asymptomatic. He continued to have elevated BPs 
during this admission and so had his antihypertensive regimen 
titrated. He was on a regimen including an increased dose of 
lisinopril at the time of discharge. 

# Leukocytosis: Admitted w/ a WBC of 20K. Thought to be reactive 
in the setting of DKA. WBC downtrended over the course of the 
admission, and the patient had no localizing signs/symptoms of 
infection.

CHRONIC ISSUES 
=============== 
# Hyperlipidemia: Continued home atorvastatin
# Hypothyroid: Continued home levothyroxine 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:

multiple strokes w/ residual left hemiparesis, HTN, DL, and 
prior colon cancer s/p hemicolectomy who is transferred from 
___ for continuity of care after presenting 
there w/ confusion and worsening LUE weakness. 

ACTIVE ISSUES:
============
#Odynophagia/Dysphagia: Most likely radiation esophagitis, 
reflux esophagitis. ___ EGD with esophagitis, gastritis, 
duodenitis. Gastric biopsy showed H. pylori. She was given 
viscous lidocaine with meals, BID PPI, fluids as needed, and a 
regular diet. We had long discussions about her goals of care 
with both her outpatient oncology team as well as her palliative 
care team (detailed below) and it was ultimately decided to not 
pursue full antibiotic therapy for H. pylori as her primary 
symptom of odynophagia is most likely primarily related to 
strictures and radiation esophagitis. 

#Failure to thrive
Seems like most likely etiology is poor po intake. Felt to be 
due to progressive esophagitis (presumably radiation induced). 
She has odynophagia. TSH wnl. No e/o pulmonary infection. UA neg 
at OSH. C diff negative this admission. Geriatrics was involved 
in the patient's care during this admission. Her throat and body 
pain was controlled with IV morphine, and she received viscous 
lidocaine to help her eat/drink more comfortably. She was 
supported with IVF as needed. ___ and OT evaluated her and 
recommended rehab placement however after long discussions of 
her GOC and it was decided that she would not want tube feeding 
and would like to go home on hospice. 

#Nonocclusive thrombus in right IJ
In the setting of being hypercoagulable from malignancy. 
HAS-BLED score is 3 (HTN, stroke Hx, age she is at high risk for 
major bleeding, but is hypercogulable iso malignancy. The 
definitive treatment for her hypercoagulable state is treatment 
of her malignancy, if within GOC. Her home ASA/Plavix were 
continued, and she was started on enoxaparin 80 mg SC daily, 
with the plan to treat for 1 month.

#Stage IIIA Squamous Cell Lung Carcinoma
#Bilateral lytic scapular lesions
Most recent imaging, CT chest on ___, revealed substantial 
decrease in size of the pre-existing right hilar mass, which now 
measures 20 x 20 mm in diameter. However CT abd revealed ""new 
1.3 cm hepatic segment VII lesion ... suspicious for 
metastasis."" ___ elevated this admission, consistent with liver 
involvement. Now CT from ___ revealed new bilateral lytic 
scapular lesions.
Outpatient team arranging PET scan in ___, with future 
cancer treatment directed therapies to be determined. Her 
outpatient oncology team (Drs ___ was contacted 
with updates. Hip/femur x-rays were obtained to eval for 
osseous/lytic lesions (because of delays with scheduling a bone 
scan).

#Encephalopathy 
She's been having episodes of confusion for some time now per 
daughter. She locked herself in the bathroom last week. 
""Thetiles have me locked in the bathroom and I can't get out."" 
But the bathroom was not locked. A few weeks ago, she had left 
the stove on during a hot day, and she stated she was heating 
food for her son (who was murdered ___. Daughter is 
concerned
about dementia. MRI brain did not reveal mets or new stroke. 
although pt is oriented x 3, she seems to have poor insight into 
reason for admission and her hospitalization. Confusion possibly 
also due to impaired sleep (sleeps during day, as lives with her 
son who works nights), dehydration, pain from malignancy. 
Geriatrics was consulted and assisted with her care. Her 
nutrition and hydration status were optimized and her pain was 
controlled with IV morphine. She received high dose thiamine for 
possible Wernicke's encephalopathy. She received folic acid 
repletion for severe protein calorie malnutrition.

CHRONIC/RESOLVED ISSUES:
========================
#Worsening LUE and LLE weakness - stable
#History of CVA w/ residual hemiparesis
Likely recrudescence from prior CVA and improved w/ hydration 
and nutrition. Her home aspirin, Plavix, and atorvastatin were 
continued. Her neurologic status was checked daily. She was 
started on Lovenox ___aily.

#Severe protein calorie malnutrition: 
- Nutrition was consulted. She received a regular diet, high 
dose thiamine, folic acid and MVI. Her electrolytes were 
monitored daily and repleted as needed.

#Tobacco Abuse: Continued nicotine patch.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
[] Due to esophageal spasms seen during EGD, outpatient 
esophageal mannometry should be considered to further work up 
her dysphagia/odynophagia.
[] Consider starting a bisphosphonate, if osseous metastases are 
confirmed through bone scan/bone biopsy.

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___ 
___.

WHY WAS I IN THE HOSPITAL?
- You were having pain in your throat and body. You were not 
getting enough to eat and drink. Because of this, you were 
weaker than usual, which made your old stroke symptoms seem 
worse. Your children were concerned that you were more confused 
than usual.

WHAT HAPPENED TO ME IN THE HOSPITAL?
- You received scans to make sure that you did not have a new 
stroke.
- You were watched closely for signs of infection.
- You were supported with fluids and nutritious food.
- You underwent an endoscopy procedure, which showed a lot of 
inflammation that is probably causing your swallowing pain. You 
were given liquid lidocaine for throat pain, as well as an acid 
blocker medicine. 
- Your body pain was treated with morphine.

WHAT SHOULD I DO AFTER I LEAVE THE HOSPITAL?
- Continue to take all your medicines and keep your 
appointments.

We wish you the best!

RADIOLOGY:

___ CT A/P:
1.  High grade small bowel obstruction likely caused by 
adhesions -with the 
transition point at the level of the umbilicus within the right 
anterior 
abdominal wall with upstream dilation of small bowel loops which 
are fluid 
filled, with complete collapse of the distal small bowel loops . 
 Surgical 
consultation is recommended. 
2. No bowel perforations. 

___ Portable abdomen:
  
1. Nonspecific bowel gas pattern without evidence of 
obstruction. 
2. NG tube is visualized with the tip terminating at the gastric 
antrum. 
3. Second catheter projecting over the superior mediastinum for 
which clinical 
correlation is recommended, as above. 

___ CXR:
Mild pulmonary edema and bibasilar atelectasis.

___ CT A/P:
1. Focal small bowel ileus involving loops of small bowel 
leading up to the new surgical anastamosis.  No bowel 
obstruction as suggested by distal passage of orally ingested 
contrast beyond the anastomosis. 
2. No extraluminal contrast seen to suggest anastomotic leak. 
3. New bibasilar opacities and small bilateral pleural 
effusions.  This likely represents atelectasis, aspiration 
pneumonitis is also a consideration. 
4. Nonobstructing 5 mm left lower pole nephrolithiasis. 

___ CXR: 
1. Nasogastric tube terminates in the distal stomach. 
2. Interval improvement of pulmonary edema and left basilar 
atelectasis. 
  

___ CXR PICC: after advancement
IMPRESSION:    
Right PICC line tip in mid SVC. 

___: ECHO 
Suboptimal image quality - poor apical views. Ascites.   
Conclusions   
 The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial 
pressure is at least 15 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses 
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Left 
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF = 75%). The 
right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right 
ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall 
contractility. There is abnormal septal motion/position 
consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic 
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral 
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There 
is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Significant 
pulmonic regurgitation is seen. The end-diastolic pulmonic 
regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery 
diastolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. 
Ascites is present.   

___: CXR
IMPRESSION:  
The left-sided PICC line has the distal tip in the distal SVC.  
Heart size is prominent but unchanged.  There is again seen a 
left retrocardiac opacity and atelectasis at the lung bases.  
There is coarsening of the bronchovascular markings without 
overt pulmonary edema.  There are no pneumothoraces. 

___: LUNG VQ scan:
IMPRESSION: 1. Low likelihood of acute pulmonary embolism. Mild 
irregularity on perfusion images and moderate to severe defects 
on ventilation defects likely representing airways disease.  
2. Right lung is foreshortened compared to the left lung which 
is not accounted for on chest radiograph ___.  Chest 
radiograph is recommended to rule out a pleural effusion.

___ disease who was admitted to the hospital with a 
small bowel obstruction requiring urgent open laparotomy and 
found to have mild pulmonary hypertension.

#SBO s/p Open Laparotomy. Ms. ___ was admitted to ___ 
___ after evaluation in the Emergency 
Department where she was found to have a small bowel obstruction 
on CT in the setting of previous abdominal surgeries and prior 
SBO. She was admitted to the Acute Care Surgery service 
overnight ___ for conservative management of her high grade 
bowel obstruction with low threshold for operative intervention. 
A nasogastric tube was placed for decompression and she had 
bowel rest with IV hydration and serial abdominal exams. In the 
evening of the same day, she was taken to the operating room for 
exploration with an exploratory laparotomy and lysis of 
adhesions, small bowel resection after failure of conservative 
management. Findings include 2 areas of dense matted adhesions 
of knotted small bowel loops, more proximally in the mid ileum 
and about one foot distally in the LLQ bowel was adhered to the 
rectus muscle. There was chronic thickening of the bowel wall 
between these sections with matting and this section was 
resected and a primary anastomosis was completed.

#Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Unclear etiology but could 
be multifactorial from a component of pulmonary HTN and volume 
overload. Patient was diuresed with 10 mg IV Lasix BID with 
resolution of hypoxia.

#SVT
#Pulmonary Hypertension: She was transferred to the SICU with 
hypotension and SVT. She received 5mg metoprolol IV for SVT, an 
NGT was placed, and she had a CT A/P with PO contrast. This 
imaging found focal small bowel ileus with no obstruction as 
oral contrast passed the anastomosis, with no evidence of 
extravasation to support a leak. However, she was seen to have 
bibasilar opacities and small bilateral pleural effusions and an 
incidental left lower pole nephrolithiasis. On ___, she had a 
transthoracic echocardiogram for SVT with findings that included 
demonstrated hyperdynamic left ventricle (EF 75%), hypertrophied 
right ventricle with abnormal septal motion consistent with 
right volume overload, as well as severe pulmonary artery 
hypertension and significant pulmonic regurgitation, moderate 
tricuspid regurgitation, with thickened valves and ascites. She 
was diuresed with IV 10 Lasix BID. Because of frequent episodes 
of SVT, she was started on metoprolol tartrate 12.5 mg po BID 
that was then switched to metoprolol succinate 25 mg. Right 
heart catherization showed mild pulmonary hypertension with no 
immediate need for inpatient treatment and follow up in clinic.

#CAUTI: Urine culture shows pansensitive E. Coli. She received 2 
days of Bactrim before switching to macrobid in the setting of 
diarrhea to complete a 7-day course. 

#Thrombocytopenia: Patient developed thrombocytopenia. Per 
hematology, this could be a side effect from Bactrim and her 
peripheral smear was negative for schistocytes or platelet 
clumping. She had a negative PF4.

Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker 
or cane).","Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to the Acute Care Surgery Team at ___ with 
abdominal pain and found to have an obstruction in your 
intestine. You were taken to the operating room for an 
exploratory laparotomy, lysis of adhesions, and small bowel 
resection to take out a piece of your small intestine that was 
stuck together and causing a blockage. After this, you had care 
in the ICU for rapid heart rate and low blood pressure. There, 
you had an echocardiogram to look at your heart, which found 
evidence of pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure in an 
artery from the right side of your heart to your lungs). You 
also had extra fluid, which was slowly relieved by giving you 
furosemide which caused you to urinate off extra fluid.  

The pulmonary service was involved in your care for this new 
diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension and they recommend a right 
heart catheterization. You had mild pulmonary hypertension and 
you should follow up with the lung doctors ___ ___ months for 
possible treatment.

Your abdominal incision had minor redness, and some of your 
staples were removed and a new dressing was placed. After a few 
days, a wound vacuum dressing was put on to help heal your wound 
faster and remove the fluid there. 

You were also found to have a urinary tract infection, which was 
treated with antibiotics. 

ACTIVITY:
o Do not drive until you have stopped taking pain medicine and 
feel you could respond in an emergency.
o You may climb stairs and should continue to walk several times 
a day. 
o  You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until 
you see your surgeon at your next visit.
o  Don't lift more than ___ lbs for 4 weeks. (This is about 
the weight of a briefcase or a bag of groceries.) This applies 
to lifting children, but they may sit on your lap.
o You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable.
o You will need to stay out of bathtubs or swimming pools for a 
time while your incision is healing. Ask your doctor when you 
can resume tub baths or swimming.
 
HOW YOU MAY FEEL: 
o  You may feel weak or ""washed out"" for a couple of weeks. You 
might want to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you.
o  You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your 
throat during surgery.
o  You might have trouble concentrating or difficulty sleeping. 
You might feel somewhat depressed.
o  You could have a poor appetite for a while. Food may seem 
unappealing.
o  All of these feelings and reactions are normal and should go 
away in a short time.  If they do not, tell your surgeon.
 
YOUR INCISION:
o You may shower with covering your vacuum dressing*******. You 
may wash over your staples, allowing the warm water to run over 
the incision. Pat dry, do not rub. Do not bathe, soak, or swim 
until cleared by your surgeon.** MAY DIFFER DEPENDING ON VAC ETC
o Your incisions may be slightly red around the staples. This is 
normal.
o You may gently wash away dried material around your incision.
o Avoid direct sun exposure to the incision area.
o Do not use any ointments on the incision unless you were told 
otherwise.
o You may see a small amount of clear or light red fluid 
staining your dressing or clothes. If the staining is severe, 
please call your surgeon.

 
YOUR BOWELS:
o Constipation is a common side effect of narcotic pain 
medications. If needed, you may take a stool softener (such as 
Colace, one capsule) or gentle laxative (such as milk of 
magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of these 
medicines without a prescription.
o If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain 
moving the bowels, call your surgeon. 
 
PAIN MANAGEMENT:
o It is normal to feel some discomfort/pain following abdominal 
surgery. This pain is often described as ""soreness"". 
o Your pain should get better day by day. If you find the pain 
is getting worse instead of better, please contact your surgeon.
o You will receive a prescription for pain medicine to take by 
mouth. It is important to take this medicine as directed.
o Do not take it more frequently than prescribed. Do not take 
more medicine at one time than prescribed.
o Your pain medicine will work better if you take it before your 
pain gets too severe.
o Talk with your surgeon about how long you will need to take 
prescription pain medicine. Please don't take any other pain 
medicine, including non-prescription pain medicine, unless your 
surgeon has said its okay.
o If you are experiencing no pain, it is okay to skip a dose of 
pain medicine.
o Remember to use your ""cough pillow"" for splinting when you 
cough or when you are doing your deep breathing exercises.
If you experience any of the following, please contact your 
surgeon:
- sharp pain or any severe pain that lasts several hours
- pain that is getting worse over time
- pain accompanied by fever of more than 101
- a drastic change in nature or quality of your pain
 
MEDICATIONS:
Take all the medicines you were on before the operation just as 
you did before, unless you have been told differently.
If you have any questions about what medicine to take or not to 
take, please call your surgeon.

We wish you the best,

all psychotic symptoms. However, review of the medical record 
reveals a longstanding history of severe mental illness with his 
first psychiatric hospitalization at age ___ and numerous 
subsequent hospitalizations for mania and psychosis. Mental 
status on my examination is notable for a young man with 
adequate hygiene and grooming, who appears paranoid at times but 
with adequate eye contact, flattened prosody of speech,
""fine"" mood, with blunted affect and somewhat disorganized 
thought process, limited insight and judgment. Cognitive 
examination is notable for concrete thought process. Discharge 
mental status exam is unchanged. 
. 
Diagnostically, differential diagnosis includes schizophrenia 
with affective features vs. BPAD with persistent cognitive 
deficits. Of note, it seems clear that his ongoing cannabis use 
is contributing to his current presentation, although I'm not 
clear how much or how often Mr. ___ is using marijuana. 
Regardless of diagnosis, given concerns for his ability to care 
for self, he met ___ criteria for inpatient admission for 
evaluation of medications, discharge and safety planning.

medication, including Zyprexa, which he consistently declined 
throughout his hospitalization.
- Collateral was obtained from his mother and father, who stated

months now but without unsafe behaviors; however, they did note 
he had appeared more stressed following the knowledge that his 
grandfather had passed away in ___. The parents had no 
safety concerns with the patient being discharged.

- Of note, a considerable amount of time was spent during this 
hospitalization discussing the risks and benefits of 
antipsychotic medications, and I was clear with Mr. ___ that 
I believed he could benefit strongly from medication. He stated 
he would continue to think about it and seemed amenable to 
following up with an outpatient psychiatrist and therapist once 
discharged. He consistently denied suicidal ideation, thoughts 
of self harm, HI, thoughts of wanting to harm others during his 
hospitalization and appeared to be able to care for himself 
without difficulty with good hygiene and grooming. Therefore, 
given his strong preference to be discharged, he was discharged 
shortly after the expiration of his ___. Of note, he was 
amenable to signing a CV form, as we discussed that another day 
was needed in order to set up appropriate follow up. 
. 
#. Cannabis use disorder: discussed the pros and cons of 
marijuana use and
encouraged abstinence. Encouraged patient to participate in 
AA/NA, and he was in agreement with continuing to not use 
cannabis. 
.
#. Headaches: as noted in HPI.

advised not to take excessive amounts of these pain killers due 
to the risk of damage to his liver and kidneys."

ideation in the context of a new social stressor and recent

Ms. ___ started about 2 weeks ago at ___ 
___.
This morning Ms. ___ received a call that she would not be
able to continue in school unless she was able to pay for two
months' tuition in advance, totalling over $5,000, which is more
than she can pay right now. She began to feel desparate and
hopeless about this, and her parents were not supportive. She
began to imagine hanging herself with a belt. This is something
she has rehearsed a couple of years ago, and in ___ of this
year a friend of hers (___) killed himself in that very
manner. Around noon she e-mailed the counselor at her school,
___, ___, saying she needed to talk to her. They met,
and Ms. ___ explained that she was thinking about killing
herself because of the school situation, and told her some of 
her
past history, such as unsupportive parents, h/o abuse, h/o
bipolar disorder, and past SA. Ms. ___ instructed Ms. ___ 
to
go to the ED, so she drove here.

Ms. ___ says that since that time she has talked with a
teacher and some friends, particularly ___), who have been very supportive and saying that 
she
is inspirational to them because she is going to college, and
scolding her for trying to give up so easily. She has also 
talked

her sleep has been good. however, she has had a very low 
appetite
for a few days, only eating in the evening because she knows she
should. Her concentration has been diminished for 2 months. For
the past month she has not had fun dancing with her friends like
she used to, and she has felt like she puts on a smile but it is
not genuine. She experiences guilt because her mother tells her
that if she weren't going to school they wouldn't have so many
financial problems. She also notes decreased energy and feeling
slowed down (though no one else has pointed this out to her). 
She
says she often cries easily, particularly today. She also notes
that she broke up with her boyfriend yesterday but that it was
not a messy break-up.

In the past, she has had times of needing less sleep, talking
fast, and having racing thoughts, but she has not been
experiencing that now.","PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY (INCLUDE PRIOR HOSPITALIZATIONS, OUTPATIENT

Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.","Dear ___, 
You were admitted to ___ after presenting to your primary care 
doctor with episodes of chest discomfort. An ultrasound of the 
heart (echocardiogram) showed that your heart does not pump as 
hard as it should, a condition called ""systolic heart failure"". 
A procedure called an cardiac catheterization was performed to 
look at the blood vessels that supply the heart, as blockages to 
these arteries can cause this condition. Your cardiac 
catheterization showed clean blood vessels, which leads us to 
believe your systolic heart failure may be due to your heavy 
alcohol use. 

We have started you on several medications to protect your heart 
and help it beat stronger, but the most important thing you can 
do for this condition is to stop drinking alcohol. Please ask 
your primary care doctor about resources to help you do this. 
**Continuing to drink could be dangerous to your health and even 
fatal**

Drinking too much alcohol also puts you at risk for vitamin 
deficiences, so we recommend that you start taking folate and 
thiamine, two vitamins now included in your medication list. 

Your heart condition puts you at risk for having excess fluid 
build up in your lungs and legs. Please weigh yourself every 
morning and call your doctor if your weight increases by more 
than 3 pounds in 5 days. You should also keep a low sodium diet 
(less than 2g or 2000mg per day) and try to drink only 1.5L or 
50 ounces of fluids a day.",". Encouraged patient to observe 1.5L 
fluid and 2g Na restrictions.

# Hyperlipidemia: LDL on ___ was 130. Encouraged 
lifestyle modification to lower cardiac risk.

# Alcohol abuse: no history of withdrawal but at least 1 pint 
rum/day with last drink 10pm night prior to admission. Did not 
require lorazepam on ___ protocol, scores were ___. Social work 
did not have a chance to see patient prior to discharge. Alcohol 
cessation was strongly encouraged to patient, risks of 
continuing to drink were discussed with him. 

# Tobacco abuse: Patient declined nicotine replacement therapy. 
Encouraged cessation.

in ___ and ___, possible CHF, who presented on ___ 
following a fall from a ladder on ___, resulting in hitting 
his head. He began having left-sided weakness at home, prompting 
him to go to an OSH for evaluation. He was found to have a 
subarachnoid hemorrhage and intraparenchymal hemorrhage 
involving the frontal and right parietal lobe and was 
transferred to ___ ED for further evaluation. He was admitted 
to the neurosurgical ICU and monitored closely overnight without 
any intervention. His platelets on admission were 38 (baseline) 
and Hct was 21.5, so he was transfused 2 units of PRBCs and 
platelets. He had a repeat head CT on ___ that was stable, and 
was transferred to the floor and ultimately the medicine service

received 20 mg IV lasix x 2 and his regular 80 mg po dose, with 
an output of 2.8 L thus far. Per nursing, has been having 
increased secretions with periodic desaturations, which resolve 
with suctioning. Repeat CXR was significant for worsening 
pulmonary edema. In addition, he spiked a temperature to 101.8 
this afternoon.

# Fever/UTI - Blood cultures and urine cultures were taken. 
Chest x-ray was most consistent with fluid overload rather than 
pneumonia as was subsequent clinical course. He was started on 
ciprofloxacin then narrowed to ampicillin for pan-sensitive 
enterococcus in the urine; he should be continued for a total of 
7 day course of antibiosis, which will be completed on ___. 

# Respiratory distress - due to CHF. Lasix was given with 
improvement. An echo did not provide an obvious explanation for 
why he has a 2L O2 requirement at home after his MI, and it may 
be that pulmonary follow-up would be appropriate to consider his 
pulmonary hypertension. He was stable on his baseline O2 
requirement when discharged to the rehabilitation facility.

# Acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure
An echo was performed - results above. 

# Subarachanoid and intraparenchymal hemorrhages: he was 
initially monitored in the neurosurgical ICU and blood pressure 
controlled with IV nicardipine. Serial CT and clinical exam 
suggest resolution; most recent CT scan showed mild cerebral 
edema without shift of any midline structures and resolving 
blood with resorption of intraventricular blood. Pt did not want 
another MRA because of the length of the study and discomfort.

Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are focal 
calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3) 
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no 
aortic stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral 
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve 
prolapse. Mild to moderate (___) mitral regurgitation is seen. 
There is no pericardial effusion.

Bone Marrow Biopsy ___
DIAGNOSIS: HYPERCELLULAR MARROW WITH EXTENSIVE INVOLVEMENT BY 
PREVIOUSLY DIAGNOSED CHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC LEUKEMIA/SMALL 
LYMPHOCYTIC LYMPHOMA (CLL/SLL). SEE NOTE.
Note: Immunohistochemical stains show that the majority of the 
lymphocytes express the pan-B cell marker PAX-5. CD3 highlights 
scattered admixed T cells. CD138 highlights occasional plasma 
cells that appear polytypic by kappa and lambda light chain 
staining.

Flow cytometry ___
RESULTS:
Three-color gating is performed (light scatter vs. CD45) to 
optimize lymphocyte yield. B-cells demonstrate a monoclonal 
kappa (dim) light chain restricted population.  The co-express 
pan-B cell markers CD19 and 20 (dim), along with CD5, CD23, and 
___.  ___ not express any other characteristic antigens 
including CD10 and FMC-7.

INTERPRETATION:
Immunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by the 
patient's known chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic 
lymphoma (CLL/SLL).  Correlation with clinical findings and 
morphology (see ___ is recommended.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  ___ 
IMPRESSION: Standard position of ___ catheter. No evidence 
of acute cardiopulmonary process.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  ___ 
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute cardiopulmonary process, however, chest radiographs 
are insensitive for early detection of any infectious process. A 
CT scan examination would be highly recommended for further 
evaluation of the patient's underlying condition.
2. A triple-lumen stable central line has been placed with 
distal tip projected over the SVC.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  ___ 
Cardiomediastinal contours are normal. Aside from tiny linear 
atelectasis in the left base, the lungs are clear. There is no 
pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Right supraclavicular catheter 
tip is in the inferior SVC.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  ___ 
FINDINGS: In comparison to the previous radiograph, the central 
venous access line right has been removed. No evidence of 
pneumothorax. Unchanged subtle apical scarring in both lungs. No 
recent opacity suggestive of pneumonia. Size and shape of the 
cardiac silhouette are within normal ranges.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of pneumonia.

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST  ___ 
IMPRESSION:
1. No findings to suggest active infectious disease within the 
chest.
2. Splenomegaly and axillary and abdominal ymphadenopathy, 
compatible with patient's history of lymphoma.
3. Indeterminate lesions in left kidney, too small to 
characterize by CT. They probably correspond to small cystic 
lesions seen on ___ ultrasound, though not 
definitively characterized.
.
LUE US ___ - FINDINGS: Color and Grayscale sonographic images 
of the left internal jugular, subclavian, axillary, basilic and 
cephalic veins were obtained and of the right subclavian vein. 
Thrombus is seen in the left cephalic vein. However, normal 
color flow and Doppler waveforms were shown in all of the other 
vessels. Normal compressibility was demonstrated where 
applicable.

IMPRESSION: Left cephalic vein thrombus, no deep vein 
thrombosis.","Ms. ___ is a ___ y.o. F with high-risk CLL admitted for 
non-myeloablative MUD allogeneic PBSCT with a conditioning 
regimen that consisted of fludarabine, Cytoxan and Rituxan.

# CLL: The patient tolerated her conditioning regimen without 
any complications.  Her ___ site, however, was erythematous 
and had some yellowish exudative discharge.  She was started on 
cefepime and vancomycin for the appearance of the site and low 
grade fevers.  She had her transplant on ___ without 
complications.  Her ANCs were monitored, and she had engrafted 
by the time of discharge.  After transplant, she was started on 
cyclosporine with monitoring of her levels.  Acyclovir, 
fluconazole and bactrim prophylaxis was started.  

# Febrile Neutropenia: During conditioning, the patient was 
started on vancomycin and cefepime for low grade fevers in 
setting of erythematous ___ site.  She remained afebrile 
until post-transplant.  She was started on caspofungin, but 
continued to spike through this.  Her ___ line was removed.  
Tip was cultured and had no growth.  PICC was placed.  CT chest 
was negative. Glucan/galactomannan and CMV VL were all negative.

consulted to assist with the management of fevers in a ___ 
patient that was no longer neutropenic.  Blood cultures remained 
negative. The patient developed pain around L PICC line and US 
demonstrated superficial vein clot. Her PICC was discontinued.

obtained as a radial artery graft was desired given his younger 
age. This revealed significant califications of the bilateral 
radial arteries and thus the decision was made not to use a 
radial artery for conduit.

 On ___, Mr. ___ was taken to the Operating Room where he 
underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to five vessels. As 
the greater saphenous vein was very small in the left leg, an 
extra length was harvested from his right thigh. Please see 
operative note for details. Postoperatively he was taken to the 
Intensive Care Unit for monitoring. Over the next several hours, 
he awoke neurologically intact and was extubated. He was 
transfused a unit of red blood cells for postoperative anemia. 
He remained in atrial fibrillation which was treated with 
Amiodarone. On postoperative day two, he was transferred to the 
step down unit for further recovery. He was gently diuresed 
towards his preoperative weight. The Physical Therapy service 
was consulted for assistance with his postoperative strength and 
mobility.  

Anti-coagulation was initiated with Coumadin for atrial 
fibrillation.  He was extremely sensitive to dosing and his INR 
rose to 5.2, nec3essitating an extra hospital day as the 
Coumadin was held and the INR fell to 3.  Arrangements were made

sequence). Patient was only 3 days off plavix. Overall the 
patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was 
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and 
invasive monitoring. He arrived on Neo with increased CT 
drainage for the firt few hours and received plts, protamine and 
2 units of cells. The bleeding resolved. He remained intubated 
overnight due to hemodynamic instability. He extubated the 
morning of POD#1. He was found to be  alert and oriented x 2 and 
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact 
but mildly confused.  He remained hypotensive, requiring volume 
and a-pacing. Over the next ___ hrs he became more confused he 
pulled out his central line and chest tubes without incident. He 
has a history of alcohol use and was placed on CIWA scale. He 
remained in the unit for several days due to his confusion. He 
eventully improved and was transferred to the floor.  Beta 
blocker was initiated and the patient was gently diuresed toward 
the preoperative weight.  Pacing wires were discontinued without 
complication.  The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy","The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.

ERCP ___: 
FINDINGS: Nine fluoroscopic spot images from ___ are submitted 
for review. The initial scout image shows surgical clips ___ the 
right upper quadrant. Subsequent images show cannulation of the 
distal common bile duct with opacification of the intra- and 
extra-hepatic biliary tree. There is moderate diffuse dilatation 
of the common bile duct and central intrahepatic ducts, and 
distal filling defects are seen. These filling defects may 
represent stones or air within the biliary tree. Opacification 
of the remnant cystic duct stump appears normal and there is no 
evidence of bile leak. Per ERCP note, sphincterotomy and balloon 
sweep was performed and a 5-mm stone and sludge were removed 
from the common bile duct. 
  
IMPRESSION: Moderate diffuse dilatation of the common bile duct 
and central intrahepatic ducts with associated distal filling 
defects. Per ERCP note, sphincterotomy was performed and a 5-mm 
stone and sludge were removed. Please see ERCP note for further 
details.

is increased 
since ___. 
 
.
CXR ___:
IMPRESSION: Increased interstitial markings bilaterally

4. Redemonstration of marked duodenal thickening involving the 
second and 
third portions of the duodenum, compatible with known duodenal 
injury. 
5. Wall thickening of the hepatic flexure is likely reactive to 
adjacent 
retroperitoneal fluid collection. 
6. Moderate free pelvic fluid. 
7. Diffuse anasarca. 
.
TTE ___:

which are 
slightly smaller though more discrete than on the prior exam. 
4. Duodenal thickening compatible with known duodenal injury has 
decreased 
compared to the prior exam. 
5. Colonic wall thickening involving the splenic flexure and 
descending 
colon. Given the extent, an infectious etiology is more likely, 
such as 
pseudomembranous colitis. Ischemia is unlikely. 
.
LUE ultrasound ___:
1. Partially occlusive left basilic vein thrombus. 
2. While the left subclavian vein demonstrated normal 
wall-to-wall color flow and waveforms, symmetric to the right 
subclavian vein, a mobile, linear echogenic structure was seen 
within, and a nonocclusive thrombus may be present. 
.
CT Abdomen/Pelvis ___:
1. Stable size of the loculated right retroperitoneal fluid 
collection.  
2. Resolution of previously noted colonic wall thickening 
involving the 
splenic flexure and descending colon. 
3. Bilateral pleural effusions, improved, but not completely 
resolved. 
4. Persistent diffuse airspace disease consistent with the 
history of ARDS. 
.
CT chest w/o contrast ___:
1. Severe pneumomediastinum, pneumopericardium, subcutaneous 
emphysema ___ the neck and chest wall, developed approximately 48 
hours after insertion of the tracheostomy tube and has worsened 
since. I would recommend direct inspection of the tracheal lumen 
to exclude the development of a tracheal wall ulcer.   
2. Pneumothorax, if present, is minimal, instead simulated by 
extrapleural 
emphysema, associated with the pneumomediastinum. No 
interstitial pulmonary emphysema.
3. Progression of diffuse alveolar damage or development of 
concurrent 
pneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage.","Mrs. ___ was admitted to the floor on the ___ surgical 
service.  

Her hospital course, ___ brief: She was admitted to the floor for 
clinical observation, her abdominal pain continued to improve on 
antibiotics but her kidney function took a hit early on and 
recovered with fluid resusciation.  Concurrently, her 
respiratory function, partially due to fluid congestion as well 
as ARDS vs. multifocal pneumonia, continued to worsen which 
warranted an admission and intubation ___ the ICU.  She was 
intubated ___ and diuresed heavily leading to extubation on 
___. She again decompensated and was re-intubated on ___ ___ 
the setting of worsening fevers. She also had worsening HTN 
around this time requiring labetolol IV and nicardipine gtt. She 
has became progressively more difficult to ventilate and on 
___ she was paralyzed. She was transferred to the MICU

Her duodenal perforation was followed by serial imaging, and 
grew from small area of free retroperitoneal air to moderately 
sized (6x4 cm) fluid collections with free fluid ___ the pelvis; 
over time, these fluid collections became more consolidated with 
no need for ___ or surgical intervention.  

___ further detail, by system:

GI: Mrs. ___ was initially admitted with intense abdominal 
pain to palpation ___ the epigastric and right side of the 
abdomen.  Her clinical exam gradually improved throughout her 
early hospitalization.  Repeat CT scan on ___ showed contained, 
persistent free air ___ the retroperitoneum with interval 
decrease from ___ but repeat imaging on ___ indicated increase 
___ size of retroperitoneal collection (6.4x4.1 cm) with 
increased free fluid ___ pelvis.  CT repeated on ___ showed 
loculations of fluid but no change ___ size.  She continued to be 
intermittently febrile during course of admission despite 
antibiotics and there was concern that these retroperitoneal 
fluid collections could be source of infection.  Repeat CT 
abdomen on ___ showed that size of collections were stable.  
The collections were deemed organized and small and too 
difficult for ___ guided drainage.  Fevers eventually resolved 
with treatment of bacteremia/pneuomonia (see below).  She did 
not have abdominal pain.  She continued to have high stool 
output but was c.diff negative x 10 throughout entire hospital 
admission.

ID: She was started on broad-based antibiotic coverage of 
vancomycin, zosyn, fluconazole.  Flagyl was added empirally for 
a brief period of time when patient experienced loose stools, it 
was dc'd after Cdiff tests were negative x 3.  Blood cultures 
were sent on ___ and showed gram negative rod bacteremia; 
the antibiotics were continued and daily blood cultures were 
sent for the next six days as per ID recommendations.   Her 
antibiotics dosing was adjusted accordingly to her changing 
renal status.   Blood cultures later sent on ___ grew coag 
negative staphylococcus and entercoccus faecium.  She was 
continued on vancomycin for this and zosyn was discontinued.  
Sputum gram stain initially showed GNRs and she was covered with 
cefepime.  This was eventually narrowed to bactrim when sputum 
culture grew stenotrophomonas sensitive to bactrim.  She was 
started on a 14 day course of bactrim (___).  By 
time of discharge, she had been afebrile for three days and WBC 
was 17 (of note, WBC was consistently elevated peaking ___ the 
___ throughout hospital admission). CBC with differential showed 
rising eosinophil count, peaking at 12% by time of discharge 
(coinciding with start of Bactrim).  She should have CBC with 
differential monitored while at ___.  If by the time of 
completion of her 14 day course of bactrim, she continues to 
have signs of infection with fevers and elevated WBC, consider 
extending treatment course of bactrim.  She also completed a 
course of nystatin for oral thrush; she did not have evidence of 
thrush upon transfer to ___.   

Renal: Urine output was low ___ the initial days of the 
hospitalization and she was treated with crystalloid fluid 
boluses to which she responded appropriately.  On HD 4, her Cr 
bumped to 2.4 (from 1.1), peaked at 2.5 until it slowly trended 
downwards with aggressive hydration with crystalloid to 
2.2-->1.9-->1.6-->1.4-->...-->1.2--> 0.9.  Cr was within normal 
range by time of discharge.  

Respiratory: Over the course of the early part of her 
hospitalization, especiallly after the aggressive hydration 
following the increased creatinine, Mrs. ___ showed signs of 
fluid overload and pulmonary congestion.  She continued to sat 
___ the mid ___ on 2L nasal cannula on the floor and was 
encouraged to use the incentive spirometer.  She was treated 
with iv lasix diuresis (10 mg IVx1) on HD 7, 8 and 9 to which 
she responded ___ urine output but respiratory status had only 
minimal improvement.  On HD 9 the patient experienced a 
significant worsening of her respiratory status with O2 sats ___ 
the mid-80s and respiratory distress. She was transferred to the 
ICU where she was intubated and sedated. She required Neo 
briefly at the initiation of sedation and was quickly weaned off 
of this.  Chest xray was consistent with either hospital 
acquired pneumonia vs ARDS and her abx coverage was adjusted 
accordingly -- switching to ___ with a d/c ___ her 
flagyl and zosyn.  Her fluconazole was discontinued after a 
total of 14 days.  A bronchealveolar lavage was obtained and 
sent for culture.  CT scan on ___ showed worsening 
respiratory status concerning for ARDS vs. multifocal pneumonia. 
 Antibiotics were continued. She again decompensated and was 
re-intubated on ___ ___ the setting of worsening fevers.  She 
was difficult to wean off ventilator.  She was continued on 
antibiotics for tx of pneumonia and continued on iv lasix prn as 
needed given fluid balance ___ an effort to improve her 
respiratory status.  TTE was unremarkable with EF > 55%.  She 
was also given iv valium for anxiety related tachypnea as well 
as nebs.  Despite these efforts, she was eventually taken to OR 
on ___ for tracheostomy.  This was complicated by an 
episode of mucous plugging on ___ that required replacement 
of the tracheostomy tube.  Subsequent CXR revealed 
pneumomediastinum and b/l pneumothorax.  CT chest was performed 
that showed that that the pneumothorax was too small for chest 
tube placement.  She was managed conservatively and did not 
express any further acute changes ___ respiratory status.  She 
was eventually weaned off the ventilator and required pressure 
support only during sleep by time of discharge.  

Anemia: Hct was 38 on admission but dropped to a mean ___ the mid 
___.  She was transfused a total of 5 units during her hospital 
admission.  Hct never fell below 20.  She was noted to be stool 
guaiac positive but no source of profuse active bleeding was 
identified. 

F/E/N: She was started on tube feeds for nutrition while 
intubated.  She initially had hyperkalemia with potassium 
peaking at 8 while on tube feeds but hyperkalemia resolved when 
type of tube feeds.  She later re-developed hyperkalemia to 6.2; 
this was attributed to bactrim and she was treated with 
kayexalate prn.  She never had EKG changes with her 
hyperkalemia.  She also had hypernatremia with sodium peaking at 
148; this resolved when free water flushes were added to her 
tube feeds.  Sodium levels were normal by time of discharge. 
Calcium was mildly elevated ___ the ___ at the end of her 
hospital course; PTH was sent which was normal at 18.  She was 
evaluated by speech and swallow who fitted her for a passy muir 
valve and cleared her for regular solids and thin liquids.  She 
tolerated her diet well and was transferred to ___ with plans 
to wean off tube feeds gradually while continuing on regular 
diet.  

LUE DVT: On ___, left upper extremity ultrasound was 
obtained, showing partially occlusive left basilic vein thrombus 
and a nonocclusive thrombus ___ the left subclavian vein.  She 
was not anticoagulated for this as it was deemed low risk for 
progression to PE.","Detrol LA ? mg daily

transfer from ___ (___) for recurrent VT 
(shocked > 60 times) following an admission there on ___ for a 
syncopal episode in the setting of Vtach. 

# CORONARIES: LHC on ___: LCx patent w/stent, LIMA to LAD 
patent, known ___ occluded LAD, RCA, SVG to RCA, SCG to OM 
patent 
# PUMP: EF 25% on TTE ___
# RHYTHM: Monomorphic VT on admission. Later intermittently A-V 
paced.

# VT STORM: Pt w/CAD and hx VT/VF s/p bi-v AICD found to be in 
MMVT iso syncopal event at home w/o triggering his device. 
Required multiple shocks >60, but still had recurrent VT, 
ultimately requiring intubation for airway protection iso 
multiple shocks. Device was interrogated, revealing multiple 
episodes of AT/AF lasting minutes to hours; threshold was 
increased. No evidence of new ischemic changes on EKG, trop neg, 
and cath ___ without evidence of new/worsening CAD. Was 
medically managed w/amio gtt, lidocaine gtt, and ultimately w/ 
procainamide gtt, but continued to have intermittent VT. Was 
likely related to arrhythmogenic focus originating in extensive 
cardiac scarring secondary to lonstanding CAD. Repeat run of 
monormorphic VT on ___, which aborted with ATP. Patient 
was amiodarone loaded with 11g, and then continued on amiodarone 
PO 200mg daily and carvedilol 25mg BID. Per EP, no immediate 
plans to pursue ablation in inpatient setting given patient's 
complicated hospitalization and given no recurrent VT for over 
one week.

#ACUTE METABOLIC ENCEPHALOPATHY: Pt was agitated, requiring 
precedex, and was delirious, only A&O to place on admission. 
Noncontrast head CT negative for intracranial pathology.  
Delirium likely exacerbated from hospitalization, and 
exacerbated by retroperitoneal bleed. Per S&S, pt had swallowing 
risk iso encephalopathy and Dobhoff placed ___ and patient was 
started on tube feeds. Pt's delirium improved with 
nonpharmacologic meausures, and he was weaned from precedex. He 
was on tube feeds until cleared by speech and swallow and 
advanced to regular diet upon discharge.

# HFrEF (EF 25% on TTE ___: Known HFrEF thought to be ___ 
to extensive ischemic disease. EF 25% on TTE ___ at ___, 
reduced from prior EF 45%. TTE in house showed EF 40%, with mild 
LV cavity dilation with regional systolic dysfunction most c/w 
CAD (PDA distribution). Pt was noted to be volume overloaded at 
___ and was treated with IV Lasix boluses until euvolemia was 
reached, and then transitioned to Lasix 20 mg po, with goal 
even. Patient's home metoprolol was switched to Coreg 25 BID 
upon discharge. For afterload reduction, patient was started on 
captopril, which was initially transitioned to lisinopril 30 mg 
daily. Patient had two episodes of orthostatic hypotension on 
___ and ___ with SBPs dropping from 140s (supine) to ___ 
(standing). Patient was lightheaded during first episode, and 
SBPs increased to 110s and patient's symptoms resolved with 
500cc bolus; he was asymptomatic during second episode, and 
encouraged PO intake. Most likely that patient was slightly 
hypovolemic secondary to diuresis, and we therefore opted to 
withhold further diuresis (discontinued Lasix 20mg daily) and 
reduce losartan from 30mg daily to 10mg daily. After discharge, 
patient should be reevaluated in terms of whether he needs 
addition of a diuretic as an outpatient and whether uptitration 
of losartan is warranted based on blood pressures.

# ATN: reported b/l is 1.0-2.0. Initially exacerbated in the 
setting of hypervolemia from cardiorenal vs hypoperfusion i/s/o 
VT storm. Had significantly acute worsening of Cr to 5.4 in the 
setting of retroperitoneal bleed with concern for hypovolemia. 
Dense ATN on urine sediment on ___. Creatinine downtrending 
likely reflecting recovery from ATN, currently 1.8. Patient 
should have repeat chemistries within three days of discharge to 
ensure resolution of renal function. 

#RETROPERITONEAL HEMATOMA: Patient reported worst abdominal pain 
on ___ with H/H drop. CT abd/pelvis was obtained and showed 
large right retroperitoneal hematoma  measuring up to 11.0 x 6.0 
cm in the axial dimension and 18 cm in the coronal dimension 
with mass effect displacing the right psoas muscle and kidney 
anteriorly. Of note, patient had cath on ___ with right femoral 
access. Administered IVF and 2U pRBC and FFP x1 with appropriate 
bump in hematocrit, as well as vitamin K. Once hemodynamically 
stable and H&H stable, patient was started on GDMT for HFrEF was 
above and restarted on warfarin.  

#ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: Noted on pacer interrogation. Patient was 
started on amiodarone to be continued following discharge, as 
above. He is also on carvedilol as above. He was started on 
warfarin, which is at 2.5mg daily at time of discharge. INR at 
time of discharge is 3.0 with goal INR ___. Patient will need 
baseline LFTs and TFTs, as well as annual CXR given recent 
initiation of amiodarone. 

#TRANSAMINITIS: Had transaminitis with ALT/AST into the low 
100s. Likely related to being on rosuvastatin,  amiodarone. and 
ezetimibe. Ezetime was discontinued. LFTs currently 
downtrending. Patient will require repeat LFTs within three days 
to ensure resolution of transaminitis and for baseline given 
recent initiation of amiodarone.   

#LEUKOCYTOSIS: WBC increased to 26.6 on admission. Unclear 
etiology as patient has not been spiking fevers and has no 
infectious symptoms. C.diff negative. UTI ruled out with 
negative UCx and BCx. CXR wnl, however, he was treated for VAP 
as below due to recent pneumonia and recent intubation. 
Leukocytosis improved to WBC 9.0 at time of discharge.

#VENTILATOR ASSOCIATED PNEUMONIA: Patient had been intubated iso 
VT storm as above. He developed a leukocytosis and was started 
on vancomycin/ceftazadime for VAP, which was transitioned to 
ceftazadime only on ___, and was treated for 8 day course which 
ended on ___.

#CAD: s/p 2v CABG (___) and multiple PCIs. Hx of VT and VF 
w/Medtronix bi-v AICD in place. No new ischemic changes on EKG 
and trops flat. Cath on ___ showed Lcx patent w/stent, LIMA 
to LAD patent, known ___ occluded LAD, RCA, SVG to RCA, SCG to 
OM patent, unchanged from prior. Likely that VT is related to 
extensive cardiac scarring as above. Patiet was continued on 
home aspirin 81 mg daily and home rosuvastatin 40mg daily. 
Metoprolol was converted to carvedilolol 25mg BID for improved 
afterload control.

#Insulin-dependent diabetes: Patient was taking glargine 10 
units qhs at home. FSBGs were elevated into 400s during initial 
parts of admission. Endocrinology was consulted and pt's HISS 
was uptitrated and his glargine was increased to 30U qAM and 30U 
qhs. Upon removal of Dobhoff, pt had reduced PO intake in the 
setting of dysphagia diet and FSBGs dropped to 100s-200s. 
Reduced glargine to 10U qAM and 10U qHS and reduced mealtime 
Humalog from 4U to 2U with meals. In spite of the less 
aggressive regimen, pt continued to have AM sugars in the ___ 
(although FSBGs up to 190s-200s during the day), even with 
resumption of regular diet and improved PO intake. Opted to 
continue 10U AM lantus and discontinue ___ lantus, continue

be acidotic in ___ ED. Has been tremulous, requiring Ativan and 
Librium at ___. Ativan was initially continued in house, but was 
discontinued within 24hrs, when CIWAs trended to 0. Patient was 
counseled regarding the dangers of Etoh use, especially in the 
context of being on other hepatotoxic medications including 
rosuvastatin and amiodarone.

your heart called ventricular tachycardia. We were able to 
change the settings on your defibrillator, and also were able to 
change your medications to hopefully prevent this from happening 
in the future. 

Please continue to take all of your home medications as 
prescribed. You will be going to a rehab center to build up your 
strength. You should also stop drinking when you leave as this 
can provoke this abnormal heart rhythm.

assessment of pre-renal vs. hepatorenal syndrome, and her 
creatinine quickly improved.  Her diuretics, which had initially 
been held for renal failure, were restarted; she was unable to 
have a significant negative diuresis but maintained relatively 
even I+Os once uptitrated to lasix 40 mg po bid and aldactone 
100 mg/d.  She required two large volume paracenteses during 
this admission, in which a total of 6.5 L was removed (2L, 
4.5L).

As part of workup for cirrhosis, outside records were reviewed, 
which indicated a normal a1-antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin levels.  
Iron levels were WNL, although one note mentions a high 
transferrin saturation and a possible workup for 
hemachromatosis.

On our workup, hepatitis A, B, C serologies were sent and were 
negative, including HbsAb.  ___ neg, IgG/IgM WNL.  Anti-SMA 
was positive at 1:20 titer.  At this time we believe the 
anti-SMA titer is not significant enough to raise strong 
clinical suspicion for an autoimmune hepatitis, especially given 
a strong EtOH history and an AST/ALT ratio consistent with this. 
 Further assessment to be done as as an outpatient.

# leukocytosis - DDx initially worrisome for cholangitis (given 
CBD dilation on RUQ U/S) or SBP (although diagnostic para in ED 
was negative; this was in the setting of ongoing levofloxacin

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___. You were admitted 
for worsening lower leg swelling and worsening shortness of 
breath with walking. We were concerned that you may have had a 
clot travel to your lungs and you were started on a blood 
thinner. Tests showed that you most likely did not have a lung 
clot. The blood thinner medication was stopped. You most likely 
have heart failure due to a combination of factors including 
your obstructive sleep apnea, weight, and high blood pressure 
given that these symptoms have been getting worse over the last 
year to weeks. You were given a pill to help you urinate which 
helped remove fluid from your lungs. You improved during your 
stay: leg swelling improved, and you did not require oxygen at 
time of discharge. You were sent home with this medication (to 
help remove extra fluid) as well as potassium supplements.

Before you left, you noticed that the tops of your feet were 
red. We were not concerned for infection and we encouraged you 
to keep your feet elevated when sitting. Please bring this to 
your PCP's attention if it has not resolved by the time of your 
appointment.

RUQUS at ___
Right upper quadrant ultrasound showed moderate intrahepatic and
extrahepatic biliary ductal dilation with cause not identified.
Further evaluation with CT or MRI/MRCP recommended. Distended
gallbladder containing small amount of sludge. No definite
sonographic evidence of acute cholecystitis

MRCP ___. 3.0 x 2.6 cm ill-defined mass-like region of hypointense 
signal on T1 weighted imaging and hypoenhancement in the 
pancreatic head with restricted diffusion.  Findings could 
reflect lymphoma, especially in the setting extensive 
retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, or an inflammatory process such 
as autoimmune pancreatitis.  Metastatic disease or primary 
pancreatic malignancy are also considerations but the latter is 
less likely given the absence of upstream pancreatic ductal 
dilatation.  Correlate with biopsy/cytology.  Depending on the 
results, short-term imaging follow-up may be helpful. 
2. Extensive retroperitoneal adenopathy, differentials include 
metastatic disease versus lymphoma. 
3. Common bile duct stent in place.  Enhancement of the biliary 
duct and pneumobilia, likely reflect post procedural change. 
4. 6 mm pancreatic cystic lesion, likely a side-branch IPMN. 
5. Pancreas divisum.

A single stricture that was 15 mm long was seen at the lower 
third of the common bile duct. There was moderate 
post-obstructive dilation.

her over and saw pt's bottom jaw retracted and top part of mouth 
sticking out, eyes open, arms straight out stiffly. Tongue was 
starting to come out, and pt was ""banging up against the bed."" 
After ___ min, convulsions stopped, and pt developed heavy 
breathing/snoring. Her eyes kind of cracked open but she was not 
responsive to daughter. EMS came and brought her outside, but 
head was flopping around as they were transporting her. When 
they got close to ___, pt started to ""come to"" and kept 
taking off the O2 mask. Seemed to go ""in and out"" of 
consciousness per daughter. She would get intermittently 
agitated, pupils were dilated, and she would have episodes of 
intermittent staring where she did not seem to be registering

IMAGING/STUDIES
CT A/P: ___- 1. Mild to moderate intra and extrahepatic 
biliary ductal dilatation with
probable calculus in the distal common bile duct indicative of 
choledocholithiasis.  If needed, MRCP can provide further 
confirmation and assessment.
2. Edematous pancreas with peripancreatic fat stranding and 
fluid most suggestive of acute interstitial edematous 
pancreatitis.  In the setting of probable choledocholithiasis, 
constellation of findings likely indicate gallstone 
pancreatitis.  Correlation with serum amylase and lipase levels 
are
recommended.
3. Cholelithiasis.  Pericholecystic fluid and stranding may be 
secondary to pancreatitis.
4. Extensive atherosclerotic disease with severe stenosis of the 
SMA and right renal artery with resultant atrophy of the right 
kidney.
5. Bilateral nodular adrenal glands which are incompletely 
characterized.
6. 0.5 cm pulmonary nodule in the right upper lobe.  Please see 
recommendations section.

MRI Brain w/ and w/o: ___: 1. Motion limited exam.
2. No evidence for acute infarction.
3. Nonmasslike FLAIR signal abnormality within the right 
posteriorperiventricular white matter, with discontiguous foci 
of cystic encephalomalacia and no evidence for blood products.  
These may represent sequela of prior infarction, demyelination, 
infection, or other insult.
4. Small chronic infarcts in the left cerebellar hemisphere. 
Punctate cortical FLAIR hyperintensity in the right frontal lobe 
may also represent a chronic infarct.
5. Small area of FLAIR hyperintensity and contrast enhancement 
in the right occipital cortex, with associated chronic blood 
products, and with questionable involvement of the adjacent 
sulci.  This may represent a chronic infarct with hemorrhagic 
transformation or sequela of amyloid angiopathy.
6. Small chronic microhemorrhage in the right posterior internal 
capsule, most likely hypertensive.
7. 6 mm round structure in the region of the left petroclival 
confluence, with diagnostic considerations including a 
cholesterol granuloma, another type of lesion, or an aberrant 
blood vessel.  Partial left mastoid air cell opacification.","================
PATIENT SUMMARY:
================
___ year old woman who presented with generalized tonic-clonic 
seizure in the setting of gallstone pancreatitis who was found 
to have right side renal artery stenosis. Seizures were 
controlled with keppra and patient underwent cholecystectomy and 
patients blood pressure was well controlled with medical 
management.

ACUTE ISSUES:
=============

#Generalized tonic clonic seizures: 
Patient presented after a witnessed generalized tonic-clonic 
seizures. She presented to the emergency room and seizures were 
initially controlled with ativan in the emergency room. 
Neurology followed the patient during this hospitalization for 
workup of seizures. Patient was found to have gallstone induced 
pancreatitis which is believed to have caused seizures in a 
patient with underlying susceptibility given history of CVA. She 
underwent cholecystectomy. Infectious workup was negative. LP 
was preformed which was bland. MRI demonstrated existing 
infarcts, but no evidence of acute infarction or intracranial 
process. The patient was maintained on Keppra 1500 BID and had 
no further seizures during hospitalization. Neurology recommends 
that the patient continue keppra 1500 BID indefinitely until 
potential modification by outpatient neurology in 6 months. If 
there is concern for mild encephalopathy and gait unsteadiness, 
Keppra could be decreased to 1250 mg twice daily prior to 
follow-up. She was started on atorvastatin and aspirin for 
primary prevention of CVA. 

#Renal artery stenosis:
Patient was found to have right sided renal artery stenosis on 
CT during hospitalization. Systolic blood pressure were 
initially 170 systolic. Her blood pressure was controlled with 
nicardipine drip. Vascular surgery evaluated the patient and 
recommended no surgical intervention. She was medically managed 
with oral antihypertensive regime and blood pressure was 
successfully controlled to the 100-160s systolic. she should 
continue lisinopril, amlodapine and labetalol as an outpatient.

#Gallstone pancreatitis 
Patient was found to have choledocolithiasis induced 
pancreatitis. She underwent cholecystectomy and had an 
uneventful postoperative course. Pain was well controlled with 
oral oxycodone in the postoperative period. The patient will 
follow with acute care surgery two weeks after discharge.

Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___ 
___!

WHY WERE YOU ADMITTED?
You were admitted to the hospital because you had seizures.

WHAT HAPPENED IN THE HOSPITAL?
Your seizures were controlled with medication. You were found to 
have abdominal pain caused by inflammation in your gallbladder 
and pancreas. Your gallbladder was removed and this helped the 
inflammation. We think that your seizures were caused  by the 
inflammation in your gallbladder and pancreas. You were also 
found to have hypertension caused by a partial blockage to the 
artery for your right kidney. You were started on new 
medications to treat your blood pressure and your blood pressure 
improved.

WHAT SHOULD YOU DO AT HOME?
You should continue the new medications for your seizures and 
blood pressure and follow up with the surgeons and neurologist 
at your next scheduled appointment. You also have a primary care 
physician appointment scheduled for you to follow up and 
establish care. You will have to discuss with the new PCP about 
cardiologist referral for your peripheral vascular disease that 
was treated with aspirin, Plavix, and procedures in your lower 
extremity arteries in ___ last year. As you know, your 
Plavix was stopped due to GI bleeding that occurred in ___ 
last year. You need a new cardiologist to continue to manage 
your antiplatelet agents.

Because you had a seizure, please do not drive a car until you 
are cleared by your Neurologist. 

Please work on switching your insurance to ___ so that 
you can continue to get care here. 

Thank you for allowing us be involved in your care, we wish you 
all the best!

ACUTE ISSUES
==============
#Acute on Chronic SDH
Unwitnessed fall at her nursing home. CTH at OSH significant for 
a left SDH and the patient was transferred for neurosurgical 
evaluation. Patient was taking Coumadin for history of Afib and 
INR at OSH was 2.9, Kcentra and vitamin K was given and INR on 
arrival to our ED was 1.2. Patient was admitted to the 
neurosurgery service and transferred to the ___ from the ED. 
Coumadin was held on admission. Patient remained what appeared 
to be at her neurological baseline. CTH in the AM on ___ 
revealed a slightly larger left SDH and a very small right 
frontal SDH. Discussion was held with the patient's family and 
an MMA embolization was offered and the family declined 
intervention. On ___, the patient's neurologic checks were 
liberalized and she was transferred to the floor. Given 
vomiting, had repeat CT Head ___ which was stable from prior.

#Atrial Fibrillation, on coumadin
CHADS-VASc = 3 for age and female gender. On warfarin, 
amiodarone, and metoprolol at home. This admission, patient was 
continued on metoprolol and had episodes of RVR as well as 
episodes of bradycardia. Metoprolol was adjusted to prior home 
dose and HRs remained stable. Amiodarone was held in the setting 
of prolonged QTc. Warfarin was held in setting of acute on 
chronic SDH, with plans to continue holding until 2 week 
follow-up NCHCT with neurosurgery.

#Prolonged QTc
Noted on initial ECGs. Likely secondary to multiple medications 
that can prolong the QTc. Several medications were stopped and 
repeat EKG with QTc<500. Later in hospital course, QTc was 
rechecked and was in 500s. Continued to hold home medications 
that can contribute to prolonged QTc at time of discharge.

___
Pt with Cr 1.3 during admission in setting of poor PO intake, 
improved with IVF. Also with orthostasis with SBP 100s lying 
down to ___ standing, as well as decreased UOP. s/p another 1L 
LR and no longer orthostatic with improved urine output. Cr on 
discharge was 1.2.

#Asymptomatic Pyuria
UA with 13 WBC and moderate leuks however patient was 
asymptomatic and without dysuria or suprapubic tenderness on 
exam. Had leukocytosis to 12 later in admission which resolved 
after IVF, possibly representing hemoconcentration. Overall not 
concerning for active infection.

#Fall
Unwitnessed fall at nursing home. Unclear what work up was 
performed at OSH. Here she has had episodes of RVR on telemetry. 
No murmurs on exam to suggest valvular pathology. NO infectious 
signs/symptoms. Orthostasis is possible, however BPs have been 
stable this admission. Likely etiology was mechanical fall as 
etiology. Evaluated by ___ and recommended to go to ___ 
rehab.

#Heartburn
#GERD
On day of discharge, patient reported epigastric and left-sided 
chest pain as well as nausea and lightheadedness. Received tums 
and symptoms completely resolved. Also received aspirin x1 
however low suspicion for cardiac etiology. EKG obtained and was 
stable from prior, no ST or T wave changes. Vitals were stable 
during the event. Trops <0.01 x2. Likely represented 
heartburn/reflux given rapid improvement with tums. Was given 
Maalox/Diphenhydramine/Lidocaine for symptoms. Had also been 
receiving home PPI daily during admission. 

#Vomiting
#Constipation
Pt with vomiting x2 later in admission, not taking much PO as a 
result. CT Head ___ stable from prior. Pt asymptomatic and 
denied abd pain, n/v at those times, no localizing symptoms. 
Suspect constipation a large driver. Increased bowel regimen. Pt 
did not have further episodes of vomiting and remained 
asymptomatic.

#T2 and T4 compression fractures (diagnosed at OSH)
Per family she suffered a fall about 4 weeks ago and was dx with 
a T2 and T4 compression fracture at that time. She was 
discharged from the ED without intervention and recommendation 
to follow up with her PCP who ordered ___ TLSO brace. She has no 
back pain or midline spinal tenderness and has been ambulating 
without any brace for 4 week now. Neurosurgery felt that she did 
not require a brace or any further intervention. It was felt 
that she may continue activity as tolerated.

# Anion gap metabolic acidosis
Progressively downtrended bicarb in the absence of clear 
etiology. No uremia, lactate wnl, UA without evidence of 
ketones. No significant diarrhea. Improving at the time of 
discharge.

#Nutrition
Concerns about poor PO intake from nursing staff and son. 
___ by nutrition who recommended 4 Ensure Enlives per day. 
Pt was given thiamine 100mg daily as well as phosphorus 
repletion. 

CHRONIC ISSUES: 
=============== 
#CKD
Cr remained wnl and stable this admission. 

#HLD
Continued on home simvastatin 10mg qPM

#Hypothyroidism
Continued on home levothyroxine 50mcg daily

#Alzheimers
Continued on home memantine 5mg PO BID, ramelteon 8mg qPM prn.

Coumadin, chronic kidney disease, COPD on 2L O2, severe 
pulmonary hypertension who is presenting as a transfer from ___ 
___ for concern for 3rd degree heart block. 

The patient was recently admitted to ___ in ___ for 
syncope. She was walking through a store to buy medications for 
her constipation and she became lightheaded, weak, and she fell 
to the floor and hit her head. She endorsed epigastric pain 
prior to event but no other prodrome of diaphoresis, nausea, or 
tunnel vision. The event was thought to be due to pulmonary HTN 
from
chronic COPD as her TTE showed elevated PA pressures as well as 
a possible orthostatic component. She was given gentle fluids 
and her Lasix was held but resumed at a decreased dose prior to 
discharge.  She was also given prednisone 30mg PO daily, 
levaquin 250mg daily, and started on albuterol nebulizers. She 
was discharged on 2L NC with plan to get outpatient PFTs. 

She states that she has not been the same since discharge.  She 
used to be  able to walk her dog around the block multiple times 
but in the past month, she has been so short of breath she has 
not been able to walk her dog at all. The most activity she is 
able to perform is chores around the house. She has noticed 
lower extremity swelling but no orthopnea, PND, nausea, or 
vomiting.
She does not weigh herself as she does not have a scale but she 
does not think she has gained weight. She manages all of her 
medications on her own and does not think she missed any doses. 

The patient was cooking dinner for herself the night prior to 
admission when she developed a sharp chest pressure in the left 
side of her chest.  The pain progressed so she called EMS.  She 
denied any palpitations, shortness of breath, nausea, or 
vomiting.  The pain lasted about one hour. When EMTs arrived, 
she was bradycardic to the ___. 

On arrival to ___, her blood pressure was 82/39 with a heart 
rate of ___. EKG was concerning for complete heart block. She 
had minimal response to atropine so was started on transvenous 
pacing without capture. She was then given pushes of 
epinepherine then started on an epinepherine drip. Her lowest 
blood pressure was 70/40. Labs were notable for a creatinine of 
3.1, potassium of
6.2, ph on the VBG of 7.10 with a pCO2 of 34 and a bicarbonate 
of 10. She was then given IVF boluses and started on a 
bicarbonate drip. She was also given 1 amp of calcium gluconate 
and 3mg of glucagon given concern for AV nodal blockage 
overdose. 

The patient was transferred to ___ for further management of 
complete heart block.  Blood pressure was 90/40 on transfer and 
she was placed on epinepherine and norepinephrine. In the ED, 
epinephrine and norepinephrine were weaned off and she was 
placed on dopamine 2.5 mcg/kg/min. 

In the ED,  
 - Initial vitals were:  
97.3 66 100/58 12 96% 3L NC 
 
 - Exam notable for:  
None documented 

 - Labs notable for:  
WBC of 27.6, hgb of 8.5, plt of 338

Na of 141, K of 5.9, Cl of 115, HCO3 of 13, BUN 46, Cr of 2.8 

ALT of 21, AST of 51, ALP of 89, Tbili of 0.4

VBG with ___
lactate of 1.9

 - Studies notable for:  
CXR with Apparent opacities projecting over the right lower lung 
may partially be due to costochondral calcifications but cannot 
exclude possible lung parenchymal opacities.

 - Patient was given:  
 IV DRIP DOPamine 2.5 mcg/kg/min 
500 cc IVF
IV Calcium Gluconate 1 gm 

On arrival to the CCU,  the patient endorses shortness of breath 
mildly improved from prior.  She denies any chest pain, nausea, 
vomiting, palpitations, dysuria, urgency, frequency, or 
diarrhea. She has been eating and drinking normally over the 
past few days.

The pulmonic valve leaflets are not well seen. The tricuspid 
valve leaflets appear structurally normal. There is moderate 
[2+] tricuspid regurgitation. There is moderate to severe 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial 
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Moderate to severe pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. Right ventricular cavity dilation with free wall 
hypokinesis. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.

RENAL U.S. Study Date of ___ 6:20 ___

2. Small right pleural effusion. 

CXR (___)
Heart size is top-normal.  Mediastinum is stable.  Right basal 
opacities are minimal and unchanged, unlikely to represent 
infectious process but attention on the subsequent radiographs 
is recommended to this area.  No pleural effusion or 
pneumothorax is seen 

___: CT chest w/o contrast:

1.  No evidence of interstitial lung disease. 
2.  Moderate upper lobe predominant centrilobular emphysema.

atelectasis. '' 
4.  Coronary calcification. 
5.  Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis. 
6.  Few small lung nodules measuring up to at most 4 mm.  These 
are very 
likely benign, but noting emphysema may be appropriate to 
consider follow-up 
chest CT for surveillance in ___ year. 
  
RECOMMENDATION(S):  Follow-up chest CT is recommended for 
surveillance of very 
small, probably benign, lung nodules in ___ year.3. 

___: RUQUS with duplex 

1. Patent hepatic vasculature.  No evidence for portal vein 
thrombosis

secondary to 
hepatic congestion. 
3. Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis. 
4. Small right pleural effusion. 

V/Q Scan: 
FINDINGS:
 
Ventilation images demonstrate irregular tracer distribution in 
both lung
fields.
 
Perfusion images demonstrate irregular tracer uptake in both 
lung fields, worse
on the left compared to the right.  All perfusion images are 
matched but less
apparent than the defects noted on ventilation imaging.
 
Chest x-ray shows bibasilar infiltrates and pulmonary 
congestion.
 
IMPRESSION: Ventilation images more apparent than perfusion 
images, most
consistent with COPD/airways disease.  No clear evidence of 
pulmonary
thromboembolism.

ACUTE ISSUES: 
============= 
#Bradycardia
The patient presented with bradycardia in the setting of 
electrolyte disturbance and acidosis as transfer from ___ 
___. Reportedly at the OSH her ECG was concerning for 
possible atrial fibrillation w/ complete heart block and both 
atropine and transcutaneous pacing were attempted prior to 
transfer. Of note, on arrival to ___ she was noted to be in 
atrial fibrillation w/ slow ventricular response and rates 
___. Sequence of causality is unclear: ie, if patient was 
bradycardic leading to decreased renal perfusion and thus an 
acidosis or if patient was acidotic due to renal failure (or 
other cause) leading to bradycardia. However, given lack of 
other end organ damage, more likely the latter. Her troponins 
were negative so unlikely to be ischemic in etiology. She is on 
high doses of metoprolol and Diltiazem at home and denies taking 
more medications than prescribed. On arrival, the pt was briefly 
on a dopamine drip. In this setting, her metoprolol and 
dilitiazem were held and her metoprolol was slowly reintroduced. 
Her Bradycardia resolved. 

#Pulmonary Hypertension 
The patient had evidence of volume overload with elevated JVP 
and lower extremity edema consistent with right sided heart 
failure exacerbation. However with diuresis, the patient became 
orthostatic. RHC showed severe pulmonary hypertension. Likely 
group III iso oxygen dependent COPD but evaluation for other 
causes was recommended by pulmonary. Group I work up included 
___, ANCA, CCP, anti-centromere pending at time of discharge, 
C3: 110, C4: 23, RF: <10, anti-RNP: negative, HIV: negative. She 
is s/p RUQUS with doppler for portopulmonary HTN: No evidence of 
porto-pulmonary HTN. Group III work up: was unable to acquire 
full PFTs - (spirometry, DLCO, lung volumes), has appointment on 
___. A Non con CT chest: demonstrated emphysema. Regarding 
group IV workup, a VQ scan was performed without evidence of PE. 


#HFpEF
Patient with new diagnosis of HFpEF with evidence of right-sided 
HF likely secondary to COPD given elevated RV pressures on her 
TTE, right axis deviation/low limb lead voltage on her EKG. She 
is chronically on 3L but had an increased oxygen requirement 
intitially. She was initially diuresed with IV Lasix but this 
was ultimately held given mild ___. TTE this admission notable 
for RV dilation w free wall hypokinesis. She was diuresed with 
IV Lasix transitioned to torsemide. Held ACEi in the setting of 
___. Received metoprolol as above, continued to hold diltiazem. 
Imdur was discontinued given absence of angina. Continued with 
IV Lasix lead to orthostatic hypotension and RHC was done to 
evaluate for volume overload. PCWP was normal at 10 and CI was 
normal at 2.82. PA pressure was ___ (47) consistent for severe 
pulmonary hypertension as above. At discharge, diuretic was her 
home dose of furosemide 10mg PO. 

#Atrial Fibrillation
CHADS2VASC of 5 on warfarin. INR supratherapeutic on admission, 
initially held diltiazem and metoprolol iso of bradycardia. High 
doses of AV nodal blocking agents suggest that she has difficult 
to control rates. She had intermittent bouts of AF w/ RVR to 
150s while her nodal agents were being held. We restarted her 
metoprolol and uptitrated to metoprolol tartrate 25mg q6H (her 
home dose of metop) and consolidated to 100mg succinate prior to 
discharge. Anticoagulation was continued with warfarin 3 mg 
after correction of coagulopathy. 

#Coagulopathy
On arrival pt's INR was supratherapeutic to 6.0 with prolonged 
PTT and decreasing platelets. Possibly in the setting of 
congestive hepatopathy vs. due to changes in her PO intake prior 
to arrival. She was given PO vitamin K for three days, w/ 
normalization of her INR. Fibrinogen normal, blood smear showed 
1+ schistocytes. Warfarin was restarted as above. 

#Iron Deficiency Anemia 
Pt w/ Hgb ___ this admission. Required intermittent pRBC. Her 
iron studies are consistent w/ Fe deficiency anemia (Ferritin 
31, TIBC 300, Fe 17). Stool guaiac positive, but brown. Likely 
slow lower GI bleed iso supratherapeutic INR. INR reversed with 
vitamin K and Hgb stabilized. She should undergo EGD and a 
colonoscopy as an outpatient, but had adamantly refused 
inpatient evaluation. She received IV iron repletion x3 days. 

#Non-Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: 
Patient with non anion gap metabolic acidosis with respiratory 
acidosis. Bicarbonate is chronically around 18 but ph was 7.16 
on presentation. Non anion gap metabolic acidosis likely due to 
renal failure from worsening heart failure or injury due to 
hypotensive event. She required small quantities of bicarb 
initially before her pH normalized. Renal was consulted while 
she was inpatient and improved without intervention.

___ on CKD: Patient has been seen by nephrologist with workup 
notable for negative spep, upep. Baseline creatinine in ___ 
~1.5. Give exertional dyspnea, lower extremity dyspnea, and 
volume overload, likely pre-renal from decreased effective 
circulatory volume. Cr was 2.8 on admission and improved 
initially with diuresis. Diuresis was restarted with increase in 
Cr. on discharge Cr was 1.7. 

#Positive blood cultures 
#Leukocytosis 
#Possible Cellulitis
She was briefly on vancomycin for possible GPC bactermia, but 
given speciation as CoNS only in one bottle, suspect this may 
have been contaminant. She had a full infectious workup which 
was negative and we transitioned her to Keflex to complete a 5 
day course for cellulitis (___). 

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
#Diabetes mellitus: on levemir 10U SQ qhs so switched to 
glargine 10mg qhs with sliding scale insulin while inpatient.

#COPD: Baseline 3L of home O2 with extensive smoking history.

Thank you for allowing us to participate in your care. 

WHY WAS I ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL?
- Your heart rates were extremely slow.

WHAT DID YOU DO FOR ME WHILE I WAS HERE?
- Your heart rates were monitored closely.
- We slowly restarted some your medications to control your 
heart rates.
- You were treated with antibiotics for a possible skin 
infection. 
- Your blood was too thin, so we held a few doses of your blood 
thinner until it normalized. 
- You had a right heart catheterization which showed severe 
pulmonary hypertension so you were seen by lung doctors . 

After you leave:
================
- Please take your medications as prescribed.
- Please attend any outpatient follow-up appointments you have 
upcoming.
- Your primary care doctor ___ refer you to a local 
pulmonologist. We would also recommend that you follow up with a 
pulmonary hypertension specialist here at ___. We have made an 
appointment for you (see below) and there are pulmonary function 
tests scheduled for the same day. If you feel that you do not 
want to keep this appointment, please call the clinic to cancel. 

- Please work with your primary care provider to monitor your 
warfarin level or INR closely, if the level is too high it can 
cause bleeding. If it is too low, it can increase your risk of a 
stroke. 
- Please ask your primary care doctor to assist you in finding a 
pulmonologist close to your home. They can help further evaluate 
the causes of your shortness of breath. 

It was a pleasure participating in your care! We wish you the

.
* Gait instability
This is probably multifactorial. Dehydration was a significant 
factor upon admission. Her hyponatremia, likely hypovolemic in 
etiology, may also have been relevant to her overall sense of 
weakness. Though she was admitted with concern for possible 
Parkinsons, she does not have any clear exam findings to suggest 
this such as tremor or cogwheeling. NPH is worth considering, 
but seems less likely. There may be a vestibular component of 
her gait instability as well, especially given her multiple ENT 
procedures. She has outpatient neurology follow-up scheduled. A 
cardiac contribution was considered given her history of prior 
syncope with question of sick sinus syndrome. After fluid 
resuscitation, patient no longer orthostatic and Na trending up. 
She was evaluated by physical therapy who felt that it was safe 
for her to go home with physical therapy. 

.
* Hyponatremia
By history, likely hypovolemic in etiology and improving on 
discharge. HCTZ could be contributory, and was held on discharge 
as patient appeared euvolemic with good BP control off the HCTZ. 
 Patient stated her appetite was better on discharge (possible 
hyponatremia was contributing).

IMAGING and STUDIES
====================
TTE ___
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial 
pressure is at least 15 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, 
cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). 
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion 
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Tissue Doppler imaging 
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure 
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, 
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets 
are mildly thickened (?#). There is severe aortic valve stenosis 
(valve area <1.0cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. 
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery 
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Severe aortic valve stenosis. Mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular 
systolic function. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. Mild mitral regurgitation. Increased PCWP. 

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: 
The patient has severe aortic valve stenosis. Based on ___ 
ACC/AHA Valvular Heart Disease Guidelines, if the patient is 
asymptomatic, it is reasonable to consider an exercise stress 
test to confirm symptom status. In addition, a follow-up study 
is suggested in ___ months. If they are symptomatic (angina, 
syncope, CHF) and a surgical or TAVI candidate, a mechanical 
intervention is recommended.

IMAGING:
___ Left foot radiograph:
Note is made of prominent soft tissue swelling along the foot, 
particularly along the dorsum of the foot. 
  
There is diffuse osteopenia with mild IV joint degenerative 
change.  Minimal spurring along the distal first metatarsal.  
Possible small subchondral cyst at the base of the distal 
phalanx.  There is some non-aggressive periosteal new bone along 
fourth metatarsal without underlying fracture or lesion.    No 
fracture, dislocation, bone erosion, or radiopaque foreign body 
is detected. Small (8.6 mm long) linear focus of calcification 
along the plantar aspect of the hindfoot, deep to the navicular 
bone, is noted, likely a small focus of dystrophic 
calcification. 
IMPRESSION: 
Soft ___ swelling. No fracture or focal bone destruction 
identified. 

___ CT HEAD 
No acute intracranial process.

___. No fracture or acute malalignment of the cervical spine. 
2. Severe degenerative changes of the cervical spine, most 
prominent at the C3-4 and C4-5 levels with severe spinal canal 
stenosis and bilateral neural foraminal narrowing. 

EKG:
Sinus rhythm. Low limb lead QRS amplitude. Left axis deviation 
with left 
anterior fascicular block. Diffuse non-specific ST segment 
flattening in the inferolateral leads. Slightly delayed anterior 
R wave progression in  
leads V1-V3 of uncertain significance, although prior 
anteroseptal myocardial infarction cannot be excluded. Clinical 
correlation is suggested. No previous tracing available for 
comparison. Diffuse repolarization abnormalities suggest an 
ongoing metabolic process, less likely ischemia. Clinical 
correlation is suggested.

# Cellulitis: Pt is admitted wtih left foot cellulitis with left 
shift leukocytosis and presents tachycardic and hypotensive to 
SBP in ___, which was fluid rseponsive, and confused. Pt was 
started on IV vanc for possible MRSA, given h/o of having 
completed a course of keflex BID but with persistent erythema.  
BCx showed no growth.  Pt's sx improved, cellulitis was 
receding, so pt was discharged on clindamycin PO x10days. 
.
# Syncope: It is unclear given the lack of great history how the 
patient feel, in the setting of being in the bathroom for BM or 
urinating, he may have had a vasovagal episode. In setting of 
fevers and chills for 24 hrs prior to fall, he may haev been 
hypovolemic. He also has h/o meniere's disease, so may have had 
dizziness, though would expect that to persist despite treating 
infection andhypovolemia. Most likely vasovagal or hypovolemic 
given infection fevers and chills and was urinating/having BM at 
time of syncocap, though pt does not recall and wife did not 
witness. CT head and neck neg for acute injury from fall. EKG 
shows normal sinus rhythm and left axis deviation.

failure: The patient has known history of AS and CHF since 
___. She presented with 2 weeks of shortness of breath and 
evidence of volume overload by exam and chest xray. Her daughter 
denied dietary discretion or medication non-compliance. Her 
decompensation is most likely related to her aortic stenosis. 
She was diuresed with IV lasix with good result. She was also 
treated with albuterol and ipatropium nebulizers for wheezing. 
Near to discharge, she was transitioned to PO lasix 40mg BID. 
She was continued on her outpatient carvedilol and losartan.  
- We recommend keeping her I/O even or slightly negative.  
- Recommend checking renal function in 1 week to ensure that we 
are not overdiuresing.
. 
2. Aortic stenosis: The patient has known history of aortic 
stenosis. Recent TTE performed by Dr. ___ an aortic 
valve area of 0.75 cm^2 with peak valve gradient of 65. She was 
admitted for decompensated heart failure and there was concern 
that this may be due to progression of her AS. She underwent 
cardiac catheterization to further evaluate her aortic valve. 
Cath revealed moderate aortic stenosis with a valve area of 1.0 
cm^2 and peak valve gradient of 34. Given these results, 
surgical intervention was deferred and the decision was to 
manage medically, as above.
. 
3. Rhythm: EKG and telemetry monitoring revealed that she was in 
normal sinus rhythm with frequent PVCs and PACs.  
.  
4. Coronary artery disease: No known history of CAD. No previous 
cath. No new ischemic changes on EKG. CE neg x 1. Pt denies CP.

5. Type II Diabetes mellitus: continued lantus, covered with 
HISS, held glipizide while in house.  We uptitrated her lantus 
and sliding scale ___ hyperglycemia.  If diet stable at rehab, 
consider restarting her glipizide and discontinuing her sliding 
scale.
.  
6. Hypertension: Initially she was borderline hypertensive. Her 
losartan was held just prior to and after her cardiac cath for 
renal protection. With re-initiation of losartan, her blood 
pressure is well-controlled. She was also continued on her 
outpatient regimen of carvedilol.
. 
7. Urinary tract infection: She had positive UA in the ED and 
was started on ciprofloxacin for complicated UTI given her 
chronic indwelling foley. Urine culture was sent after 
initiation of antibiotics and was negative. She will continue 
cipro to complete a 14 day course of antibiotics.  Last day will 
be ___.

- Do not drink alcohol, drive, or operate machinery while you 
are taking narcotic pain relievers (oxycodone/dilaudid).
- As your pain lessens, decrease the amount of narcotic pain 
relievers you are taking. Instead, take acetaminophen (also 
called tylenol). Follow all instructions on the medication 
bottle and never take more than 4,000mg of tylenol in a single 
day.
- If you need medication refills, call your surgeon's office 
3-to-4 days before you need the refill. Your prescriptions will 
be mailed to your home.
- Please take lovenox for 2 weeks to help prevent the formation 
of blood clots.
 
Constipation
 
- Both surgery and narcotic pain relievers can cause 
constipation. Please follow the advice below to help prevent 
constipation.
- Drink 8 glasses of water and/or other fluids like juice, tea, 
and broth to stay well hydrated.
- Eat foods that are high in fiber like fruits and vegetables.
- Please take a stool softener like docusate (also called 
colace) to help prevent constipation while you are taking 
narcotic pain relievers. 
- You may also take a laxative such as senna (also called 
Senokot) to help promote regular bowel movements. 
- You can buy senna or colace over the counter. Stop taking them 
if your bowel movements become loose. If your bowel movements 
continue to stay loose after stopping these medications, please 
call your doctor.
 
Incision
 
- Please return to the emergency department or notify your 
surgeon if you experience severe pain, increased swelling, 
decreased sensation, difficulty with movement, redness or 
drainage at the incision site.
- You can get the wound wet/take a shower starting 3 days after 
surgery. Let water run over the incision and do not vigorously 
scrub the surgical site. Pat the area dry after showering.
- No baths or swimming for at least 4 weeks after surgery.
- Your staples/sutures will be taken out at your 2-week follow 
up appointment. No dressing is needed if your wound is 
non-draining. 
- You may put an ice pack on your surgical site, but do not put 
the ice pack directly on your skin (place a towel between your 
skin and the ice pack), and do not leave it in place for more 
than 20 minutes at a time.

Patient with neck pain and LUE weakness since ___. MRI with
severe canal narrowing at C3-4 and C4-5 due disc osteophyte
complexes. There appears to be thickening of the anterior and
posterior epidural space at C3-4 and C4-5, which may be due to
prominent epidural fat or ligamental thickening. Evaluated by
spine in the ED who recommended a Medrol dosepack and follow-up
in clinic in one week as symptoms do not appear consistent with
MRI findings. Ortho spine also recommended a CT scan which did 
not show evidence of hardware complication or fracture. Repeat 
neuro exam with intact strength in all extremities with improved 
radiation down arm. Patient was admitted due to intractable 
pain. Her pain was managed with APAP, hydromorphone, lidocaine 
patch, methocarbamol, and the steroid taper. Her pain improved 
from admission and ___ recommended out patient ___. She may 
benefit from revision decompression and fusion procedure with 
spinal surgery.

IMAGING 
==========================
___ CT A/P
IMPRESSION:
1. Diffuse colonic wall edema could be secondary to portal 
hypertensive colopathy. However, there is relative increased fat 
stranding around the ascending colon and cecum as well as 
hyperemia that is concerning for possible colitis particularly 
given the patient's symptoms on the right.
2. Cirrhotic liver with sequela of portal hypertension including 
recanalization of the umbilical vein common extensive varices 
(including gastric and esophageal), splenomegaly, and small 
volume ascites.  Overall heterogeneous enhancement is likely 
related to cirrhosis, but cannot exclude focal lesions.  If 
concern, nonurgent dedicated hepatic imaging could be 
considered.
3. Extensive gallbladder wall edema is likely the sequela of 
chronic liver disease given the absence significant gallbladder 
distention.However, this could be further evaluated with a HIDA 
scan, if clinically indicated.
4. Diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.

___ RUQ U/S
IMPRESSION:
1. Cirrhotic liver with evidence of portal hypertension 
including a recanalized umbilical vein and small volume ascites.
2. Extensive gallbladder wall edema is likely related to chronic 
hepatic disease given the absence of significant gallbladder 
wall distension and cholelithiasis.  If clinical concern, 
however, HIDA scan could be considered for further evaluation.

___ CTA A/P
IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of mesenteric ischemia.
 2.  Cirrhotic-appearing liver with sequelae of portal 
hypertension including ascites, splenomegaly, colopathy, 
recanalization of the paraumbilical vein, and numerous 
collaterals as well as gastric varices.
 3.  Nonspecific diffuse colonic edema with surrounding fat 
stranding, likely from portal hypertensive colopathy, but 
concurrent colitis from infection or inflammation is probable.
 4.  No evidence of active hemorrhage on this exam.
 5.  Mild sigmoid diverticulosis.
 6.  Gallbladder edema is likely from third spacing and reactive 
in setting of liver disease with ascites.

___ HIDA SCAN
IMPRESSION: Abnormal hepatobiliary scan with delayed appearance 
of tracer into the gallbladder.  At 4 hours minimal tracer is 
noted in the gallbladder fossa.  Findings most consistent with 
chronic cholecystitis; however, the minimal tracer uptake in the 
gallbladder fossa at 4 hours and the appearance of edema on CT 
makes it difficult to entirely rule out acute cholecystitis.

___ ABDOMINAL FLAT/UPRIGHT
IMPRESSION:
1. Diffuse mild gaseous distention of the small bowel loops 
without abnormal
dilation of small bowel nor large bowel suggests ileus.
2. Mild thickening of the wall of the transverse colon is 
consistent with
known history of colitis.
3. No free intraperitoneal air seen on left lateral decubitus 
view.

___ CXR
IMPRESSION: 
No acute cardiopulmonary process or evidence pneumonia.  
Probable small
pleural effusions bilaterally.

___ RUQ ULTRASOUND
IMPRESSION:
1. Cirrhosis with evidence of portal hypertension including 
splenomegaly,
small to moderate volume ascites, and a recanalized umbilical 
vein.
2. Gallbladder wall edema is likely related to chronic hepatic 
disease given
relative gallbladder ___.
3. Cholelithiasis.

==============
___, incarcerated with PMH of Alcohol Abuse (complicated by 
DTs/Seizure, sober since ___, seizure disorder, h/o TBI, 
hemochromatosis, EtOH/HCV cirrhosis (c/b varices, banded in 
___, T2DM who presented initially to OSH with acute onset of 
fever and abdominal pain. Imaging showing mostly complications 
of portal hypertension but given acute onset of fevers, pain, 
lactate elevation, and bilirubin elevation was consistent with 
cholecystistis, confirmed on HIDA scan. Transplant surgery and 
internventional radiology were consulted who deemed patient too 
high risk to undergo invasive intervention. Cholecystitis was 
managed with antibiotics with adequate response. Patient was 
also seen hepatology who recommended outpatient establishment 
with hepatologist to continue care for his cirrhosis. 

ACUTE ISSUES:
=============
# Acute cholecystitis:   In the MICU, warm on exam with evidence 
of abdominal infection on CT and elevated total bilirubin 
concerning for cholangitis/cholecystitis. He was treated with 
albumin infusions and pressor support with levophed, while being 
started on Ciprofloxacin and Flagyl.  Upon arrival from MICU, 
patient noted to have obvious rebound tenderness of exam. A flat 
and upright was negative for free air, HIDA scan showed minimal 
tracer uptake into the gallbladder at 4 hours.  When placed in 
context with acute onset of fevers and abdominal pain and 
leukocytosis, we presumed a diagnosis of acute cholecystitis.  
Transplant surgery was consulted, who stated Mr. ___ was 
too high risk for cholecystectomy.  Interventional radiology was 
consulted, who stated the gallbladder was not particularly 
distended, and would therefore be very hard to access for a 
percutaneous drainage procedure.  We continued antibiotics with 
Cipro and Flagyl, and his abdominal exam improved. He will be 
discharged on ciprofloxacin and flagyl to finish a 14 day course 
on ___. Transplant surgery's final recommendations remain that 
he is too high risk for CCY. Follow up with them as needed. 

#Leukopenia: As leukocytosis related to acute cholecystitis 
resolved, the patient became leukopenic to a nadir of 1.9 - 
differential mostly neutropenia and lymphopenia.  Our team was 
unsure of the patient's baseline and considered 
antibiotic-associated leukopenia.  Patient's leukopenia improved 
to 2.8 upon discharge. Will need repeat CBC on outpatient basis 
to follow up. 

# Cirrhosis: History of HE, variceal hemorrhage s/p banding. No 
history of SBP.  Likely hemochromatosis/EtOH-induced. Labs 
showing coagulopathy with decreased PLTs and elevated INR. 
Imaging showing a congested abdomen from portal hypertension. 
Hepatology consulted and an extensive work up was ordered. AMA 
negative, Anti-smooth Negative, ___ negative, Hep B negative, 
Hep C negative, HIV negative. Patient had a paracentesis with 
the following results: WBC 86, RBC 475, Total protein 1.1, LDH 
45, glucose 124, LDH 45, Albumin 0.6. No need for prophylactic 
or active SBP antibiotics. Patient was started on Lasix 20mg and 
spironolactone 50mg qd with a stable creatinine. Patient will be 
discharged on his home regimen of lactulose. 

#Bright red blood per rectum - scant BRBPR and was started on 
PPI/octreotide. Hepatology evaluated patient and given stable 
H&H and blood only while wiping, it was determined that scant 
blood most likely ___ hemorrhoids. PPI/octreotide subsequently 
discontinued. No further acute events and stable H&H upon 
discharge. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
#Alcoholism - He has an extensive history of delirium tremens 
and was maintained on his seizure prophylaxis medications 
Keppra, folic acid, and thiamine. 

#DMT2: no home regimen. Was placed on SSI and ___ QACHS. Did not 
require insulin doses consistently. Will discharge without 
medications. Will follow up with PCP regarding need for 
medications or not. 

#Portal hypertension - Nadolol was initially held given his GI 
bleed and resumed when hemodynamically stable. Will discharge 
with home regimen dosing. 

#Behavioral health: on jail record review, was on quetiapine, 
sertraline, and trazodone which was continued during hospital 
stay. No acute events. Will be discharged on this regimen. 

#Seizure disorder: continued home regimen of LevETIRAcetam 750 
mg PO BID with no changes upon discharge. No acute events.

STUDIES:
___ CXR: Interval recurrence or progression of diffuse 
alveolar 
opacification in setting of known chronic interstitial lung 
disease (NSIP/ILD leading diagnostic considerations per OMR). 
This could be pulmonary edema or widespread pneumonia or 
hemorrhage. Given the course consideration should also be given 
to drug or toxin exposure exacerbating a preexisting reaction. 

___ TTE:  Suboptimal image quality. Right ventricular cavity 
enlargement with free wall hypokinesis. Normal left ventricular 
cavity size and regional/global systolic function. Mild mitral 
stenosis.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
the right ventricular findings are new and suggestive of 
myocardial contusion. The severity of mitral stenosis has 
increased. The severity of mitral regurgitation has declined 
(may be due to tachycardia and suboptimal image quality).

___ EKG: Sinus rhythm and increase in rate as compared to 
the previous tracing of ___. There is right axis deviation 
and low limb lead voltage. There is now ST segment elevation in 
leads V1-V3 with biphasic to inverted T waves in leads V1-V5, 
more prominent as compared to the previous tracing of ___. 
The rate is increased. These findings are consistent with active 
anterolateral ischemic process. Followup and clinical 
correlation are suggested.  

CTA Wet read ___:
No PE. Some consolidations/septal thickening suggestive of fluid 
vs infection. Enlarged pulm artery suggestive of pulmonary HTN.","Ms. ___ is a ___ year-old woman with history of advanced 
interstitial lung disease, likely NSIP, CHF, DM, and chronic 
pain s/p MVA who presents with respiratory failure. 

ICU Course:
Patient was intubated in the ED secondary to respiratory 
distress and oxygen saturations in the ___. She was admitted to 
the MICU were a CVL was placed. She was treated initially 
empirically with levofloxacin and broadened to 
vancomycin/cefepime/azithromycin for empiric coverage of HCAP. 
She was also given IV steroids, then transitioned to prednisone 
40 mg daily, for an ILD flare per her outpatient pulmonologist, 
Dr. ___. Influenza swab was sent and returned negative. Sputum 
cultures grew commensal respiratory flora and yeast. She was 
also diuresed with IV lasix given an elevated BNP of 1023 over 
her baseline of 363 from ___ and overload on CXR. IV Lasix 
40mg IV was effective and diuresis. Echocardiogram showed 
findings of RV free wall hypokinesis c/w contusion related to 
MVA as well as mild MS ___ MR. ___ cardiology recommended 
further evaluation with TEE as this valvular disease may be 
contributing to her heart failure. She was extubated on ___ 
with return to her baseline home oxygen requirement. Just prior 
to transfer to the floor patient was started on morphine 
60mg/30mg/60mg PO TID for her chronic fibromyalgia neck and 
shoulder pain.

*ACTIVE ISSUES*
# Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure:  The patient is on 
daily lasix 60 mg at home and has a history of chronic diastolic 
heart failure secondary to rheumatic heart disease (echo in ___ 
showed EF>55%, mild-mod MV regurg).  Her dyspnea was thought to 
be due to volume retention in the setting of starting steroids 
for baseline lung disease.  In the MICU she was started on IV 
lasix 40 mg with good response.  On the floor her lung exam was 
notable for bibasilar crackles and high-pitched inspiratory 
squeaks, as well as bipedal pitting edema.  She was therefore 
continued on IV lasix with resolution of dyspnea and improved 
lung exam.  Her oxgen requirement was lowered to her baseline of 
6L NC.  A repeat CXR on ___ showed substantial improvement in 
pulmonary edema compared to the prior study of ___.  To 
evaluate the role of mitral valve dysfunction on CHF 
exacerbation, she also underwent a repeat echo given poor window 
of bedside TTE in the MICU.  The echo was largely unchanged from 
her prior in ___, with preserved EF 70% and mild resting left 
ventricular outflow tract obstruction.  Rheumatic mitral valve 
deformity was noted along with mild MV stenosis.  Cardiology 
recommended starting the patient on low-dose metoprolol due to 
concern for CHF exacerbation from tachycardia/decreased filling 
time in the setting of the patient's MR/MS. ___ tolerated 
metoprolol succinate 12.5mg daily well. The patient was 
transitioned to po lasix 40 mg, and on this low dose continued 
to produce output ___ daily.  She appeared consistently 
euvolemic on this dose.  Her Cr remained stable throughout this 
period.  On discharge her weight was 100.2 kg, compared to her 
baseline weight of 101.2 kg (___).  The CTA on day of 
discharge revealed signs of some fluid overload and decision was 
made to send her home on 60mg daily (her usual home dose) and to 
likely taper down to 40mg daily if appropriate when she sees her 
primary care physician. She was discharged on lasix 60mg daily 
and metoprolol 12.5 mg daily. Pt was satting in the mid-high ___ 
on 6L at time of discharge.

# ILD: The patient has advanced interstitial lung disease with 
tissue diagnosis of fibrotic NSIP in ___. She is on baseline 6L 
O2 at home and is followed closely by Dr. ___.  While 
inhouse it was thought that her lung disease was contributing to 
her dyspnea and acute presentation.  She was therefore continued 
on prednisone 40 mg po daily.  The patient was seen by Dr. ___ 
___ recommended a slow steroid taper over ___ months with 
possible outpatient transition to azathioprine. Given her 
continuation of steroids, she was started on a PPI. She was also 
started on PCP prophylaxis with bactrim and discharged on 
Cal/VitD. 

# Diabetes mellitus:  The patient had poor glycemic control 
during her stay, with post-meal FSBG levels consistently >400.  
A HgA1c was 9.2.  Her lantus was increased to 24 from baseline 
20 with good effect.  She was started on a novolog sliding scale 
with frequent adjustment.  ___ saw the patient while inhouse 
for elevated sugars. The decision was made to STOP metformin 
given her CHF, and the patient was instructed not to resume this 
outpatient.  She was discharged on lantus 24 U qhs and novolog 
sliding scale (Starting breakfast and lunch at 12 for BG 
100-150, increase by 2; dinner at 8 Units for BG 100-150, 
increase by 2; bedtime at 4 for BG 151-200, increase by 2).

# Chronic pain s/p MVA:  Baseline chronic back pain was 
controlled with her home morphine dose 60mg/30mg/60mg PO TID 
which was started in the MICU.  She had adequate pain control 
during her hospitalization. 

*INACTIVE ISSUES:*
# Anemia:  The patient is chronically anemic and remained so 
with Hcts ranging from 27.9-31.9.  This is consistent with her 
baseline. 

# Hypertension: Patient's aldactone was held given diuresis and 
relatively low BPs on the floor.  Because she was started on 
metoprolol, her aldactone was discontinued.  

# Depression/anxiety:  The patient was continued on her home 
doses of sertraline 200 mg daily and diazepam 5 mg q6 prn.

Labs/Studies Pending at Discharge:

You were admitted to the hospital for shortness of breath. We 
believe this was most likely due to extra fluid in your lungs. 
When you first arrived to our Emergency Department, a tube was 
placed in your throat to help you breathe (intubation).  You 
were admitted to the intensive care unit, where you were given a 
medication (Lasix) to help decrease the fluid in your lungs.  
You were treated with steroids to decrease possible inflammation 
in your lungs.  You also received antibiotics to cover the 
bacteria that cause lung infections. You responded well to these 
treatments and your breathing tube was eventually removed.

In the ICU, you had an ultrasound of your heart (Echo) which 
showed slightly worsened disease of one of your heart valves 
(from rheumatic heart disease).  Your heart function is 
otherwise unchanged from your last echo in ___.  

You were then transferred to the medicine floor, where you 
completed the course of antibiotics. You were continued on 
steroids.  Your IV Lasix was transitioned to Lasix by mouth, and 
you continued to put out a considerable amount of extra fluid 
which helped your oxygenation.  Your oxygen requirements 
decreased to your home oxygen of 6 Liters.  You were able to 
ambulate on your own without issue. You will go home on lasix 
60mg daily. This dose might be lowered to 40mg daily after you 
see your primary care doctor next week if she feels it is 
appropriate.

Your sugars were found to be elevated, especially after starting 
prednisone. We had diabetes specialists see you who helped to 
titrate your insulin. You will go home on Insulin Sliding Scale 
regimen that was reviewed with you in the hospital. Please 
follow the attached Sliding Scale regimen.

On the day of discharge you had some chest pain with breathing.  
We obtained a CT scan of your lungs and it showed there is no 
clot in your lungs, this is good news.

Remember to check daily weights. If your weight goes up by 3 
pounds, please call Dr ___ might need a higher dose of 
your lasix. This is VERY important. If you can not get through 
to Dr ___ call your primary care doctor.

The following changes were made to your medications:
STOP Metformin. Do not take this medication any more. It should 
not be taken by patients with heart failure.
STOP Aldactone. You may resume this if your PCP agrees and if 
your blood pressure tolerates. We started you on metoprolol and 
decided to stop the aldactone for now.
START insulin sliding scale with Novolog, see the attached form 
for an explanation.
CHANGED lantus from 20->24 U every evening
START: Bactrim, take 1 tab daily to prevent pneumonia while on 
steroids.
START: Pantoprazole 40mg daily, take this while on steroids
START Prednisone 40 mg daily.  You will be on this medication 
until further discussion with your pulmonologist Dr. ___.   
START Metoprolol 12.5mg daily. Please take ___ pill of the 25mg 
daily. This will protect your heart from future heart failure 
episodes.
CONTINUE: Lasix 60mg daily to help remove fluid from your lungs

No other medication changes were made.  Please continue to take 
them as you have been doing.","until

3.Psychiatric:
Extensive time was spent discussing the patients diagnosis and 
psychopharmacology issues. Outpatient psychiatric medications 
were continued at home doses including fluvoxamine 100mg ___ qhs. 
As patient felt as though he did not tolerate higher doses of 
this medication in the past, clomipramine 50mg ___ daily was 
added to address both OCD and symptoms of depression, and was 
eventually uptitrated to clomipramine 100mg ___ qhs. B/R/AE/SE 
were discussed, and patient verbalized his understanding. This 
medication was well-tolerated, with mild dry throat/mouth 
occurring. To augment his antidepressant therapy, aripiprazole 
5mg ___ daily was added, B/R/AE/SE were discussed, and patient 
verbalized his understanding. Throughout his hospitalization, he 
experienced difficulty sleeping. Lorazepam 1mg ___ qhs was 
initially used, as well as hydroxyzine 50mg ___ qhs. Patient 
continued with difficulty sleeping despite increases in these 
dosages, and ultimately zolpidem 10mg ___ qhs was initiated. 
Lorazepam 1mg ___ qhs was discontinued upon initiating zolpidem, 
and was utilized on a BID PRN basis for anxiety with good 
effect. B/R/AE/SE were discussed, and patient verbalized his 
understanding. He experienced improvement in his mood, a 
decrease in handwashing behaviors, appeared less perseverative 
regarding contamination fears and experienced a reduction of 
overall anxiety/worries. While there were increased OCD 
behaviors such as hand-washing following/anticipating stressful 
family meetings with his wife, these would resolve and did not 
persist, and responded well to lorazepam 1mg PRN. Many of his 
depressive symptoms appeared to improve as his sleep pattern 
improved as well, and he was often visible attempting to 
communicate ___ peers, and was active in the milieu. He noted he 
often spent much of the day sleeping at home prior to admission, 
and he was able to establish an appropriate sleep-wake cycle 
throughout his admission. 

Patients outpatient therapist ___ (___) was 
contacted at time of admission in order to discuss circumstances 
of patients hospitalization and to obtain relevant history. At 
time of discharge, pts outpatient therapist was contacted again 
to discuss hospital course and discharge disposition.

4.Substance Abuse: 
Patient was counseled to stop smoking and abusing nicotine 
products. He was maintained on nicoderm patches throughout his 
stay.

5.Social/Milieu:
Pt was encouraged to participate in units groups/milieu/therapy 
opportunities. As the language barrier presented difficulty in 
him being able to engage in group activities, he was allowed use 
of his phone to help manage his anxiety/provide distraction, and 
also to use as a communication device. Therapy addressed 
family/social issues. Patient experienced significant social 
stressors while hospitalized, including his wife placing a 
restraining order on him and him being unable to return home/see 
his children and ultimately deciding to return to ___.
Patient and wife were involved in several family meetings 
focused on psychoeducation and discharge planning.  As patient 
was ___ speaking, interpreter services and language line 
services were utilized throughout the duration of his stay.

6.Risk Assessment:
Patient had initially denied SI/HI upon admission. While he 
developed thoughts of not wanting to be alive after learning 
about the restraining order and when he feared he would never 
see his son again, these thoughts were fleeting, and never did 
he develop a plan nor intent. These thoughts resolved by the 
following day in both instances, and he consistently 
demonstrated future and goal-oriented thinking, as evidenced by 
his verbalizing his plans to return to ___, find employment, 
and continue treatment, with the ultimate goal of being able to 
share custody of his son. Returning to ___ allows him to have 
greater social support, as in the ___ he has been 
isolated. He consistently cited his son as a reason to want to 
be alive. Protective factors include having an established 
relationship with the outpatient treater he is returning to in 
___, as well as returning to his family/support network, being 
motivated for ongoing treatment, and demonstrating future and 
goal-oriented thinking. His risk factors of experiencing an 
acute mood episode as well as his obsessive-compulsive disorder 
have been treated pharmacologically. He has been medication 
adherent, and has shown great improvement in his symptoms. At 
this point in time, he does not present an imminent risk of harm 
to self/others, and outpatient care is the least restrictive 
level of care at this time.

Imaging
___ CXR :
Small left pneumothorax has developed following removal of the 
basal and 
medial pleural tube.  There is no appreciable left pleural 
effusion, but there is a small region of consolidation in the 
left lower lobe, which could be area of focal bleeding.  Right 
basal atelectasis is new.  Heart size normal.","Mr. ___ was admitted to the thoracic surgery service for a 
left lower lobe pulmonary nodule.  He was taken to the OR and 
underwent an uncomplicated VATS LLL lobectomy with placement of 
a chest tube.  He tolerated the procedure without complications 
and recovered uneventfully in the PACU before being transferred 
to the floor in stable condition.  (Please see the associated 
operative report for specific procedural details.)  
Post-operatively his pain was controlled with a PCA and IV pain 
medication with a transition to PO pain meds once tolerating 
POs.  His diet was advanced slowly and without difficulty.  His 
chest tube was removed on POD#2 without incident and his oxygen 
saturations were > 95% on room air. He was able to use his 
incentive spirometer effectively.

Unfortunately he failed one voiding trial which required 
replacement of his Foley catheter for an additional day.  His 
second voiding trial was successful and Flomax was also started. 
 He had some confusion with the use of Dilaudid but improved 
with Ultram and Tylenol. 

Upon standing up for a chest xray he had some dizziness and 
orthostatic signs were checked.  Lying, his BP was 114/70 with a 
heart rate of 78 and standing it was 80/42 with a heart rate of 
88.  He was initially treated with IV fluids and increasing his 
oral intake of liquids.  Despite doing that his orthostasis 
persisted and an EKG demonstrated atrial fibrillation at a rate 
of 114. This was also associated with hypokalemia, 
hypophosphatemia and hypomagnesemia. After repleting his 
electrolytes and starting metoprolol, he converted back into 
sinus rhythm.

Of note, he had been on Lopressor as recent as ___ but 
after discussing the situation with his wife, she monitored him 
closely and noticed that his heart rate was in the 50's 
therefore stopped the lopressor.  There is no prior record of 
atrial fibrillation noted in his record.","The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.

evidence of acute large territorial infarct.  No intracranial 
hemorrhage. 

MRI brain ___
FINDINGS:   
There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, masses, mass effect, 
midline shift or infarction.   The ventricles and sulci are 
normal ___ caliber and 
configuration.  There is mucosal thickening ___ the visualized 
paranasal sinuses.  The orbits are unremarkable.  There is fluid 
opacification of bilateral mastoid air cells with secretions ___ 
the nasopharynx, likely secondary to intubation.

TTE ___:
Normal left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global 
systolic function (3D LVEF = 57 %). The right ventricular cavity 
is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. 
Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion is normal (1.7 cm, 
mildly abnormal ___ setting of mild RV dilation). There is 
abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent with right 
ventricular pressure overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) 
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no 
aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. No masses or 
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully 
excluded due to suboptimal image quality. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve 
prolapse. No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, 
but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.

and hypoxic and she was emergently intubated. BNP 19699, 
troponin leak to 0.44, and TTE showing dilated right ventricle 
with severe RV systolic dysfunction were highly concerning for 
massive PE. ___, she became hypotensive requiring 
epinephrine and phenylephrine. Given her hemodynamic 
instability, she was transitioned to full dose tPA.  She was 
transitioned to Coumadin with a heparin drip bridge.  Follow up 
TTE showed improvement ___ right heart strain.  She was 
discharged on Coumadin with a goal INR of 2 to 3. Given that

button for the nurse simultaneously.  Given risk to harm herself 
she was placed on 1:1 sitter.  Pt later denied any thoughts of 
self harm or symptoms of depression.  Per psychiatry, she was 
not felt to meet criteria for involuntary psychiatric 
hospitalization and patient declined offer of voluntary 
admission.  Pt was discharged with follow up scheduled with

sediment, consistent with ATN.  Creatinine peaked at 6.4 (from 
admission creatinine of 1.2).  Pt received hemodialysis for 
volume and solute clearance (from ___ to ___.  She 
developed rapid recovery so hemodialysis was discontinued and 
the HD line was pulled on ___.  Creatinine on discharge was 
1.3.  She will need outpatient follow up with nephrology.  

# BACTEREMIA, STREP VIRIDANS
Pt febrile on ___ and found to have strep viridans bacteremia. 
Strep viridans may be a contaminant, however, the patient has a 
reported h/o poor dentition and dental pain and temporarily 
related fever was concerning for true strep viridans bacteremia. 
 She was initially on IV vancomycin (___). TTE showed no 
evidence of endocarditis.  Discontinued ceftriaxone and flagyl 
___ given no recurrent fevers.  Pt remained afebrile during

Imaging:
ECHO: 
The estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. Left 
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular 
cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a 
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall 
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is mild 
aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within 
normal limits). The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure 
is normal. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. 
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a 
prominent fat pad. 

Chest x-ray PA and Lateral:
FINDINGS: The lead of the newly positioned pacemaker is in the 
region of the apex of the right ventricle. There is no evidence 
of pneumothorax, pneumonia, vascular congestion, or acute 
pleural effusion. 

Chest X-ray (portable):
FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  
A left-sided cardiac device projects single lead into the right 
ventricle.  There is no pneumothorax. The heart is mildly 
enlarged. The central pulmonary vessels are prominent, however, 
no overt edema is seen. The lung volumes are low, resulting in 
bronchovascular crowding and mild bibasilar atelectasis. No 
focal consolidation is seen.  
IMPRESSION: Post-placement of a left intracardiac device. A 
lateral view 
should be obtained if possible to fully assess placement. No 
pneumothorax.

EKG: Sinus rhythm.","# High-grade AV block: The patient was noted to have an 8 second 
pause on telemtry at outside hospital. It was unclear if this 
coincided with her syncopal episode(s). Electrophysiology at 
___ followed the patient. Based on the history of syncope and 
the significantly long ventricular pauses, the electrophysiology 
team felt that a PPM was indicated. A PPM was placed on hospital 
day 2. The patient was intubated for the proceudre and tolerated 
the procedure well. Chest x-ray showed no pneumothorax and 
appropriate lead palcement. The patient had no episodes of block 
recorded on telemetry but did have episodes of ventricular 
pacing found on telemetry.

discharged with a negative trauma workup. The next day, it was 
thought that his insulin pump was broken. His family thought his 
mental status was worsening so they took him back to the ED. 

On arrival, his labs were notable for renal failure (Cr 3.9, 
baseline 0.9), acidosis (pH 7.25), and FSBG >900 consistent with 
DKA. A code STEMI was called given a severely abnormal EKG, 
however, it was ultimately thought to be due to his electrolyte 
abnormalities (K 8, pH 6.9) treated w/ insulin IV, bicarb, 
calcium for hyperkalemia. He was treated with an insulin gtt for 
DKA. He did develop seizures while in the ED and was given 
Ativan IV. He was seen by nephrology who felt that he did not 
need emergent dialysis. Per report, his labs were normalizing by 
the morning of ___.

well as a Vecuronium gtt. Concern was raised for acute pulmonary 
edema in the setting of an NSTEMI versus ARDS versus possible 
aspiration. His pplat was <30 and peak pressure (while 
paralyzed) was 28. He was transferred on 70% FiO2 with 10 of

IMAGING
=======

CXR (___): Severe pulmonary edema asymmetric, worse in the 
right, is grossly unchanged. ET tube is in standard position.  
NG tube tip is in the stomach.  Cardiac size is top-normal.  
Moderate bilateral effusions with adjacent atelectasis have 
increased on the left.  There is no evident pneumothorax.

TTE (___): The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated 
right atrial pressure is at least 15 mmHg. There is mild 
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular 
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic 
function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %) secondary to 
hypokinesis of the anterior septum, anterior free wall, and 
apex. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are 
normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch 
levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear 
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic 
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears 
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. 
There is no pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space 
which most likely represents a prominent fat pad. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
contrast-enhanced imaging now suggests anteroapical hypokinesis.

RUQ US (___): 1.  No evidence of gallstones or biliary 
obstruction. 2.  Partially visualized right pleural effusion.

MRI head (___): 1. No acute intracranial abnormality. 2. New 
nonspecific fluid opacification of bilateral mastoid air cells.

CXR (___): In comparison with the study of ___, the 
bilateral pulmonary opacifications appears somewhat worse, 
consistent with pulmonary edema. However, in the appropriate 
clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia would be very difficult 
to exclude. There has been placement of a left subclavian pacer 
with leads extending to the right atrium and apex of the right 
ventricle.  No evidence of post procedure pneumothorax.","Mr. ___ is a ___ with a PMHx of T1DM (on insulin pump), 
obesity, HTN, HLD who is being transferred from ___ for 
hypoxemic respiratory failure and shock.

ACTIVE ISSUES

# Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Patient was transferred to 
___ from ___ after acutely developing hypoxemic 
respiratory failure. Morning prior to admission patient had an 
episode of large amount of emesis and there was concern for a 
rapid progression of evolving aspiration pneumonia. There was 
also concern for ARDS given suspicious x-ray with bilateral 
fluffy infiltrates. He was transferred paralyzed with 
rocuronium. There was also concern for new onset CHF given 
elevated troponins and new onset wall motion abnormality on TTE. 
Upon arrival to MICU at ___ patient's rocuronium was stopped. 
He was ventilated per ARDSNET protocol initially with goal Vt 
___. He was started on Vancomycin and Zosyn to treat 
possible aspiration pneumonia. PEEP was weaned and patient 
continued to improve from a respiratory standpoint and was 
successfully extubated. Vancomycin was discontinued and Zosyn 
was continued given concern for aspiration pneumonia in the 
setting of vomiting. Patient was called out to the floor where 
he did well from a respiratory standpoint. He was narrowed to 
Unasyn which was switched to Augmentin to cover for aspiration 
on day prior to discharge. He should continue Augmentin until 
___ to complete a 10 day course.

# Shock: Septic vs. hypovolemic in the setting of resolving DKA 
vs cardiogenic shock. 3 SIRS (leukocytosis, tachycardia, 
increased O2 demand) with hypotension evidence of end organ 
hypoperfusion: ___, elevated LFTs although lactate is normal. 
Unclear source of sepsis although aspiration PNA most likely 
given recent emesis and AMS. Patient was continued on 
antibiotics, and fluid resuscitated with improvement in systemic 
perfusion and resolution of shock. Patient did not require 
pressors. His hemodynamics were stable on the floor. He was 
discharged on Augmentin for possible aspiration pneumonia as 
above.

# Acute renal failure / Acidosis / Hyperkalemia - Cr on 
presentation at 3.9. Baseline 0.9, 3.5 at arrival to ___ with 
initial VBG pH 7.21. Most likely in the setting of ATN due to 
DKA/sepsis. Normal renal US at ___. The striking finding 
is that the day before presentation to ___ the patient 
was evaluated there for a trauma work up after his accident and 
his kidney function was normal with creatinine of 0.9. Given 
patient's renal failure lisinopril was held. Nephrology was 
consulted and urine microscopy showed no signs of ATN. Patient's 
urine output improved and creatinine returned to baseline. 
Lisinopril was restarted on discharge.

# NSTEMI: TnI > 70 at ___, TnT 5.5 consistent with 
severe NSTEMI. TTE without abnormalities there, but could not 
exclude acute papillary muscle rupture rupture. A repeat TTE at 
___ showed anteroapical hypokinesis with a LVEF 45%. A cardiac 
catheterization was performed once patient was extubated and 
renal function returned to normal. Cardiac cath findings showed 
a LMCA 30% narrowed at ostium, LAD was small with 50% mid and 
distal narrowing, circumflex was normal, ___ marginal 80% 
narrowed, RCA was normal and right PDA was normal. No 
intervention further intervention was performed. It was possible 
the patient had demand ischemia in the setting of shock with 
Takotsubo's less likely. Medical management with heparin gtt for 
48 hrs, high dose statin, aspirin, Plavix and beta blocker (once 
shock state resolved) were initiated. Patient was discharged on 
these medications and should follow-up with cardiologist in 
___.

# Sinus pauses: Since NSTEMI, patient's telemetry has been 
notable for episodes of pauses lasting 4s (on ___, which are 
likely secondary to vagal input with no evidence of AV Block per 
EP consult. He has been asymptomatic during these episodes 
however.  Given that pt's car drove into the woods and found 
down and the fact that he is from ___ + ___ season, worth 
r/o lyme carditis. Lyme serology is pending. EP placed a 
pacemaker on ___. He is scheduled for follow-up in device 
clinic and will need longterm EP follow-up (cardiologist in 
___ or Dr. ___.

# Altered Mental Status: After extubation the patient was slow 
to become alert and oriented. Patient's wife was concerned that 
he was still ""a little off"" even though he was A&Ox4. It is 
possible that patient's original hypoglycemic episode at the 
time of his accident contributed to his continued AMS, it is 
also possible that this was a side effect of sedation. Patient 
had an MRI of the head without any specific findings that could 
explain his symptoms. Lyme serologies were sent and were 
pending. Patient continued to improve and was approaching 
baseline on discharge. He was evaluated by OT who determined 
that he would not be safe for home in the absence of 24 hour 
care. Because of this, he was discharged to rehab.

# Transaminitis: Patient had a mild transaminitis that was 
probably due to his shock state on presentation. Hepatitis A,B,C 
workup from ___ was negative. LFTs normalized.

# GI bleed: Patient had guaiac positive emesis at ___ 
although his H/H was stable. He had some OG tube suction guaic 
positive stomach contents but H/H continued to be stable. There 
was no further evidence of GI bleed. Patient arrived with 
pantoprazole drip from ___ which was stopped and 
transitioned to BID and eventually to oral dosing. There was no 
longer concern for GI bleeding. He was discharged on 
lansoprazole.

CHRONIC ISSUES

# Type 1 diabetes: Diabetic ketoacidosis on presentation that 
was resolved with insulin drip and fluids. Once patient was able 
to tolerate PO intake he was switched to bolus plus sliding 
scale insulin per ___ recs. He will follow up as an 
outpatient to restart his insulin pump when his mental status 
recovers. He was discharged on Lantus 28 units qhs and a sliding 
scale.

acute process, although CT and X-ray did show moderate to severe 
spinal stenosis in the lumbar spine, which was likely 
contributory to his symptoms. An element of muscle spasm was 
also thought to be likely, based on his symptoms. He was given 
morphine and Percocet initially for pain control. He was 
transitioned to Percocet only, and low-dose Flexiril was added 
to aid with control of muscle spasm, as well as heat to the 
area. His symptoms continued to be significant and limiting to 
his progress with physical therapy. The Chronic Pain Service was 
consulted, and recommended a new medication regimen. He was 
given Toradol x 2 doses, and started on standing Tylenol, 
gabapentin, and tizanidine as well as oxycodone as needed. The 
following morning his symptoms had improved, and he was able to 
transition more easily in and out of bed. He was transferred to 
a rehabilitation facility for extended physical therapy.

*)Atrial fibrillation: also with a history of complete heart 
block with a pacemaker, rate-controlled on admission. His INR 
was found to be supra-therapeutic at 4.4, and his Coumadin was 
held for one day. On re-check, his INR continued to increase, so 
his Coumadin was stopped. Metoprolol was continued during his 
hospitalization. His INR will need to be followed, and Coumadin 
re-started once INR is less than 3. 
.
*)Elevated creatinine: his creatinine was at his baseline at 1.1 
on admission, with an increase to 1.3 after he received Toradol. 
This will need to be followed up with repeat labs; he did not 
receive any additional NSAIDs and was not discharged on any. On 
the day of discharge his creatinine had begun to trend back 
down.

============================
Ms. ___ is a ___ G0 female with benign endometrial biopsy and 
known 21 cm intramural uterine fibroid and multiple enhancing 
subserosal and pedunculated fibroids s/p uterine artery 
emoblization on ___, in observation for postprocedural 
monitoring. During the procedure, she was noted to be 
hypertensive to SBP 170s, for which she was given 10 mg IV 
hydralazine. She developed tachycardia post procedure thought to 
be related to post procedure inflammation, which was improving 
at time of discharge. 

Acute issues
==============================
# Post-embolization syndrome:
Following her procedure, she was noted to have persistent sinus 
tachycardia to the 120s. She was given IV fluids with some 
effect on her heart rate. She continued to remained 
asymptomatic. CT PE was limited due to the timing of the 
contrast bolus but showed no central PE. V/Q scan was negative 
for PE. Given the presence of a leukocytosis, fever, crampy 
abdominal pain, and no other localizing symptoms of infection, 
it was felt that her sinus tachycardia may be explained by 
post-embolization syndrome. However, given increases in sinus 
tachycardia to the 140s and a fever, a CT A/P was obtained which 
showed no evidence of intra-abdominal abscess.. She was 
discharged in stable condition with minimal abdominal pain and 
heart rates in the 120s. Her leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia, 
thought to be related to her general inflammatory condition, 
were improving at discharge.  Her blood cultures and urine 
culture did not suggest infection.

# Constipation: Patient with little stool output over 5 days, 
initial imaging concerning for large bowel obstruction, which 
prompted a surgery consultation. Per surgery, no acute 
intervention required, and patient subsequently passed a small 
bowel movement, although still more distended than her baseline. 
Likely ileus due to large doses of narcotic pain medications. CT 
Abdomen without evidence of large bowel obstruction. Treated 
with regular bowel regimen and improved prior to discharge.

# Anemia, acute
Patient with acute anemia noted during hospitalization.  No 
evidence of active bleeding.  Suspect a component of 
hemodilution from aggressive IV fluids as well as some 
post-embolization blood loss.  H/H stable in high 20's at 
discharge.  Will need to re-checked at PCP ___.

Chronic Issues
=======================
# Thrombocytopenia: Patient with plt of 87, has a history of 
borderline/low platelets on an outpatient basis, baseline of 
140-150 to ___. Not consistent with HIT. Did not require 
transfusion. 

Transitional Issues
=======================
- Follow up appointment was made with patients PCP ___ ___. At 
that time, vital signs should be checked and CBC to ensure 
continued resolution of WBC count, thrombocytopenia, anemia and 
tachycardia.
- Patient was noted to have baseline tachycardia of 100s-110s 
prior to uterine artery embolization. Would consider cardiac 
workup if this does not resolve after current acute 
post-embolization issues. 
- Follow up appointment was made with OB/GYN on ___ with Dr. 
___. 
- Patient was instructed to limit physical activity in the next 
few days and closely monitor for any worsening of pain, fevers 
or chills, or new symtoms such as cough, SOB or dysuria that 
could signal an infection. She understood and agreed with this

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___. 

You came to the hospital to have a uterine artery embolization. 
The procedure went well without complication. Following your 
procedure, we noted your heart rate to be elevated. We obtained 
a CT scan and a nuclear scan to investigate the presence of a 
blood clot in the lung, both of which showed no blood clot. We 
are not sure why you're heart rate is so high, but we think that 
it may be due to post-embolization syndrome, which occurs as the 
blood supply to the uterine fibroid ceases. We expect these 
symptoms to improve gradually seven days following your 
procedure. If these symptoms fail to improve, or worsen, please 
seek medical attention.

Please seek medical attention if you develop high fevers, 
chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, worsening abdominal

============== 
Ms. ___ is a ___ woman w/ Child's B decompensated EtOH 
cirrhosis (MELD-Na 15) w/ ascites necessitating recurrent 
paracentesis (last ___, admitted to ___ on ___ for further 
evaluation and management of urinary symptoms, confusion 
concerning for hepatic encephalopathy and leaking ascites from 
paracentesis site. With regards to the urinary symptoms, she was 
found to have a UTI, and was started on antibiotics with 
improvement, with plan for completion of 7-day course of 
ciprofloxacin. With regards to the confusion concerning for 
hepatic encephalopathy, this was assessed and felt most likely 
to be precipitated by the urinary infection. Her mental status 
cleared with initiation of lactulose/rifaximin, and she was 
discharged with plan for continued lactulose therapy to reduce 
the chance of future episodes of hepatic encephalopathy. With 
regards to the paracentesis site, it was no longer leaking upon 
arrival to the floor. It was monitored closely and her abdomen 
was assessed by ___ for tappable pocket given concern for 
possible SBP, with small pocket of straw-colored fluid obtained. 
The fluid analyses showed evidence of portal HTN (SAAG 2.5), low 
total protein (0.9), and negative neutrophil criteria for SBP 
(PMNs 235), without any culture growth to date at the time of 
discharge.

ACTIVE ISSUES: 
============== 
#Decompensated EtOH cirrhosis c/b volume refractory ascites 
#Concern for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis 
The patient has a history of refractory ascites secondary to her 
cirrhosis which has historically required frequent LVP (~5L, 
___. When the patient reported to her outpatient 
hepatology office following her most recent paracentesis (___), 
she reported ongoing leakage of yellow fluid from her 
paracentesis site necessitating ___ dressing changes/day, 
without any ascites reaccumulation. Per patient, this has 
happened once before with a prior paracentesis and self-resolved 
after ___ days, nonetheless, her outpatient hepatologist Dr. 
___ was concerned that she might have an evolving complication 
at the site of the paracentesis and sent her to the emergency 
room for further evaluation. By the time the patient arrived at 
the ___ ED on ___, the drainage from the paracentesis site 
had dramatically decreased; and by the time she reached the 
floor on the morning of ___, the drainage had entirely stopped, 
with only scant yellow drainage appreciable on the gauze 
padding. Despite the cessation in drainage and quiescent 
appearance of paracentesis site w/o erythema or induration or 
purulence, given the potential for clinically silent SBP she 
underwent ___ assessment for tappable pocket, during which 20 mL 
of straw-colored fluid were obtained. The fluid analyses showed 
evidence of portal HTN (SAAG 2.5), low total protein (0.9), and 
negative neutrophil criteria for SBP (PMNs 235), negative gram 
stain, without any culture growth to date at the time of 
discharge, and thus low concern for SBP at this point.

#UTI:
The patient's UA on admission showed nitrites and rare bacteria, 
and subsequently grew out pan-sensitive E-coli. Despite absence 
of urinary symptoms (dysuria, hematuria, suprapubic discomfort, 
flank tenderness), given altered mental status and laboratory 
findings was treated for presumed UTI, initially with CTX (___) 
with subsequent transfer to ciprofloxacin 500 mg BID with plan 
to complete seven day course. 

___: 
The patient was noted to have a Cr bump to 1.3 from admission 
(up from baseline 1, has been as high as 1.7 in past). She has 
known b/l renal cysts demonstrated on US imaging as recently as 
___. Her change in Cr this admission was felt to be most 
likely pre-renal in the setting of volume depletion from the

Prior to this admission, the patient had no history of hepatic 
encephalopathy and reported regular BM ___ without 
lactulose. However, on days preceding this admission she became 
more forgetful, and was noted to have b/l asterixis on admission 
exam and to have confusion about day of the week, concerning for 
first-episode of hepatic encephalopathy, likely triggered by her 
urinary tract infection. She was evaluated with US and lab w/u 
for concomitant clot or bleed trigger, and this work-up was 
negative. She was treated with lactulose/rifaximin and her 
mental status cleared, with concomitant improvement in her 
asterixis. She was discharged on maintenance lactulose taken as 
needed with titration for goal ___ BMs/day, with plan for close

It was a pleasure taking part in your care here at ___!  

Why was I admitted to the hospital?  
You were admitted for further evaluation of confusion and fluid 
that was continuing to leak from your paracentesis site (the 
site where your outpatient providers had used a needle to take 
5L of fluid out of your belly on ___. 

What was done for me while I was in the hospital?  
-We treated you with medications called LACTULOSE and RIFAXIMIN 
to help you remove the toxins which might have been contributing 
your confusion, and you improved with this treatment. 
-We found on laboratory testing of your urine that you had a 
urinary tract infection, which also could have contributed to 
your confusion. We treated you with antibiotics for this 
infection. 
-We evaluated your paracentesis site to further evaluate why it 
had been leaking. Fortunately, by the time you were brought up 
to the ___ hospital floors, the site was not leaking 
anymore, so we watched the site closely but did not need to do 
any further treatment. 
-We used special imaging techniques to look for pockets of fluid 
in your belly, we found a small pocket of fluid which was 
sampled. The sample did not show any signs of bacteria growing 
at the time of your discharge. 

What should I do when I leave the hospital?  
- You should follow-up with your outpatient providers as 
scheduled. 
- You should take your medications as prescribed for the 
duration of time specified on the prescription, including the 
new antibiotic medication to treat your urinary tract infection 
(CIPROFLOXACIN), as well as the new medication to help you avoid 
further episodes of confusion by removing out more of the 
contributing toxins (LACTULOSE)
- You should watch for new/or worsening symptoms, especially 
those listed below in the section entitled ""Danger Signs"". If 
you do not feel like you are getting better or have any other

s/p CABG and stent placement, DM2, HTN, HL who presented on 
___ with acute onset right hand weakness and possible numbness 
who was found to have left frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage.  
Etiology of hemorrhage was thought to be from a malignancy.  He 
was admitted for observation and management of his bleed and BP. 
 
.
# Neuro: On his CTA in the ED he was incidentally found to have 
2 large lymph nodes concerning for malignancy.  His aspirin was 
held.  His MRI brain showed no evidence of microhemorrhage 
making amyloid a less likely cause of his hemorrhage, and given 
the lymph nodes noted on CTA, he underwent a CT torso to 
evaluate for possible primary malignancy.   
.
# CARDS: While here we treated pt with PRN hydralazine for SBP 
>160.  We continued his lisinopril.  His SBP was occasionally in 
the 160's so we increased his metoprolol to 50mg BID (from 
metoprolol succinate 75mg QD).  We stopped pt's simvasatin given 
possible increased risk of bleeding.  On ___ he experienced an 
episode of chest pain that felt ""just like"" his usual stable 
angina pain when he exercises.  His cardiac enzymes were 
negative x2, and no changes on EKG.  As we had just recently 
explained we were looking for a malignancy, and he was very 
anxious about this, it was presumed that the anxiety elevated 
his HR to the level it normally is to activate his stable 
angina. 
.
# PULM: patient's CTA incidentally showed 2 large lymph nodes 
that were concerning for malignancy.  He then underwent a CT 
torso, which confirmed the CTA findings as well as showed 
mulitple calcifications likely from a old histoplasmosis 
infection.  He underwent a broncoscopy guided biopsy of his 
paratracheal node on ___.  This necessitated general anethesia. 
 The results of this biopsy are still pending
.
# ENDO: patient's HGA1C was 7.6, indicating that he may need 
tighter glucose control at home.  While here because he was got 
multiple CT's with contrast, we held his home glycemic oral 
medications and treated him with an ISS.  His home metformin was

You were seen in the hospital because of hand weakness and were 
shown to have had a small bleed in your head.  While here, we 
did an MRI which showed the same small bleed. We are not sure 
what caused this bleed.

We made the following changes to your medications:
1) We CHANGED your METOPROLOL SUCCINATE to METOPROLOL TARTRATE 
at 50mg twice a day.
2) We STARTED you on ATIVAN 1mg every 4 hours as needed for 
anxiety for a 1 week supply.  Do not drive while taking this 
medication as it can make you dangerously sleepy.  Do not drink 
alcohol or take any other sedating medications as this can also 
make you dangerously sleepy.

STRUCTURED FINDINGS
This echocardiogram was performed at ___ 
___.
Referred for evaluation of aortic stenosis.
Sinus rhythm.
The study was technically adequate.  2D Color and spectral
Doppler  were performed.
The left ventricle size is normal. 
Left ventricular wall thickness is normal. 
There are no regional wall motion abnormalities. 
Overall left ventricular ejection fraction is normal, with an 
estimated LVEF of 55-60%. 
Grade I diastolic dysfunction with normal ___ pressure.
The left atrium linear dimension is normal. 
The left atrial volume is mildly increased.
The right ventricle is normal in size, thickness and function. 
TAPSE and RV S' are within normal limits suggesting normal right
ventricular free wall systolic function.
The right atrium is normal in size.
The aortic valve is trileaflet and is moderately thickened. The
non coronary cusp appears fixed and moderately calcified. 
There is trace aortic regurgitation. 
The peak transvalvular velocity is 4.16 m/sec, with peak/mean
pressure gradients of  69/37mmHg , and calculated ___ by
continuity equation of 0.7cm2 (using measured LVOT diameter of
2.0 cm, and LVOT velocity of 1.0m/sec); these findings are
consistent 
withprobably moderate aortic stenosis. There is considerable
fling in the aortic valve Doppler flow, so the peak gradient
varies from low 40's up to high 60's, and therefore aortic valve
area varies from 0.7-1.0 cm sq.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. 
Mild mitral annular calcification present. 
Mild mitral regurgitation is present. 
There is no evidence of mitral stenosis.
The tricuspid valve is structurally normal. 
There is mild tricuspid regurgitation present.   
PA systolic pressure is normal, with estimated PA systolic of
30mmHg + RA pressure.
Pulmonic valve appears structurally and functionally normal.
There is no pulmonic stenosis.  There is trace pulmonic
regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The aortic root, measured at the level of the sinuses of
Valsalva,  is of normal caliber. 
Visualized portions of the ascending aorta, transverse and
descending thoracic aorta are of normal caliber.
The inferior vena cava is normal, with normal respirophasic
movement indicating normal right atrial pressure.
There is no evidence of a shunt by color Doppler from views
imaged.
CONCLUSIONS
1. Left ventricular wall thickness is normal.
2. Overall left ventricular ejection fraction is normal, with an 

estimated LVEF of 55-60%.
3. The aortic valve is trileaflet and is moderately thickened.
The non coronary cusp appears fixed and moderately calcified.
4. There is trace aortic regurgitation.
5. There is probably moderate aortic stenosis present.  There is
considerable variability in the peak gradient/aortic valve area
calculation, so there may not be a significant change in the
severity of aortic stenosis compared to ___.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
7. Mild mitral annular calcification present.
8. Mild mitral regurgitation is present.
9. Visualized portions of the ascending aorta, transverse and
descending thoracic aorta are of normal caliber.
10. Compared with the findings of the prior report of 
___,
more variability in the Dopper gradients of the aortic valve are
noted (see above).

prior PCI x4 (most recently PCI x3 8 months ago), ischemic 
cardiomyopathy (LVEF reportedly 40-45%), hypertension, 
hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation on warfarin, 
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and GERD who initially 
presented to an outside hospital with chest pain, now 
transferred for further management of ACS. He was reportedly in 
his usual state of health until ___ weeks prior to admission, 
when he developed nonradiating central/subxiphoid 
""heartburn""-like chest pain, ___ in intensity and 
unassociated with nausea, diaphoresis, or shortness of breath. 
Chest pain typically occurs in the evening at rest, often ___ 
hours postprandially, and lasts up to 4 hours, resolving without 
dedicated intervention. Chest pain is nonpositional, partially 
relieved by belching, and not clearly exacerbated by exertion, 
though he wonders on further questioning whether he may 
experience mild chest discomfort with ambulation more than 1 
block, noting that exertion has been limited recently following 
laminectomy in ___. Chest pain is reminiscent in quality to 
his anginal equivalent, but it did not occur to him initially 
that his current symptoms could be cardiac in origin. He 
initially attributed chest pain to known GERD, but there was no 
improvement with uptitration of famotidine and pantoprazole on 
evaluation by his primary care physician ___ ___. He 
ultimately decided to seek medical attention on the day of 
admission, recognizing that trial of uptitration of his acid 
reflux regimen had been unsuccessful. He denies recent fevers, 
chills, sweats, lightheadedness, palpitations, cough, URI 
symptoms, pleuritic chest pain, exertional dyspnea, PND, 
orthopnea, peripheral edema, abdominal pain, heavy NSAID or 
alcohol use, but does endorse dark stools that he attributes to 
bismuth use.

He initially presented to ___, where EKG demonstrated 
deepened lateral ST depressions as compared to prior on ___, 
and TnI was elevated to 0.19. CXR was without acute 
cardiopulmonary process. He received aspirin 324mg and SL 
nitroglycerin x1, with relief of chest pain, and heparin drip 
was initiated. Due to concern for ACS, he was transferred to 
___ for further evaluation.

In the ED, intial vital signs were: 47 106/55 18 100% 2L NC. 
Exam was notable for guaiac-negative stool. EKG was interpreted 
as demonstrating sinus bradycardia at 39 with stably deepened 
lateral ST depressions. Admission labs were notable for Cr of 
1.1, Hct of 34.8, platelets of 136, INR of 3.1, and TnT of 0.02. 
Heparin drip was continued. Vital signs on transfer were as 
follows: 50 123/56 11 98% RA.   

On the floor, he is entirely comfortable and chest pain-free.  

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: On review of systems, denies any prior 
history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary 
embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint 
pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. Denies 
recent fevers, chills or rigors. Denies exertional buttock or

insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and GERD who initially 
presented to an outside hospital with chest pain, EKG changes 
and low grade troponin elevation, and was transferred to ___ 
for further management of NSTEMI. 

# Chest pain/acute coronary syndrome: Chest pain likely reflects 
ACS in the setting of dynamic EKG changes and troponinemia, 
though postprandial nature and relief by ___ would be 
atypical for cardiac etiology, suggesting possible concomittant 
GI pathology; EGD was reportedly negative at some point in the 
past according to the patient. CXR at ___ was 
reassuring against other cardiopulmonary pathology. Troponin 
stable but elevated at 0.02. He was taken for cardiac 
catheterization which revealed 90% instent restenosis of OMB 
stent that was stented with a drug eluting stent, requiring 6 
months of triple therapy. His warfarin was discontinued on 
admission in anticipation of cardiac catheterization. 

# Sinus bradycardia: Heart rate nadired in the high ___ in the 
ED and is now 50 on arrival to the floor. He appears to be 
chronically bradycardic, likely owing to ongoing beta blockade 
and native nodal dysfunction, with heart rate of 49 on EKG 
obtained by his primary care physician ___ ___. It is possible 
that renal clearance of atenolol is compromised in the setting 
of possible mild kidney injury, with Cr of 1.1 on admission 
versus uncertain baseline. Held home atenolol in the setting of 
bradycardia; initiated low-dose metoprolol which was well 
tolerated.

# Atrial fibrillation: He is in sinus rhythm on arrival to the 
floor. CHADS score is ___ (hypertension, diabetes, +/- heart 
failure in the setting of known ischemic cardiomyopathy without 
clinical signs of heart failure).
Coumadin was held on admission in anticipation of cardiac 
catheterization. He was bridged with heparin and then restarted 
coumadin with an enoxaparin bridge as an outpatient.

# Normocytic anemia: Hct is 34.8 on admission versus uncertain 
baseline, though essentially stable from prior at ___. 
There are no stigmata of bleeding on antiplatelet therapy and 
systemic anticoagulation, with the exception of dark stools on 
bismuth, guaiac-negative in the ED.

CHRONIC:
# Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus: He notes that he takes 
___ units of glargine in the morning, depending on 
fingerstick, though he does not maintain strict parameters. 
Continued glargine 20 units in the morning with Humalog insulin 
sliding scale
# Hypertension: He is normotensive on arrival to the floor. 
Continued home isosorbide mononitrate and losartan. Held home 
atenolol in favor of low-dose metoprolol as above
# Hyperlipidemia: Although he would benefit from high-dose 
atorvastatin in the setting of ACS, he is reportedly intolerant, 
recalling severe myalgias. Continued home simvastatin
# GERD: Continue home famotidine and pantoprazole.
# Chronic low back pain: Continue home gabapentin.

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___.  

WHY WAS I IN THE HOSPITAL?  
==========================  
- You were admitted because of chest pain.

WHAT HAPPENED IN THE HOSPITAL?  
==============================  
- You were admitted to the hospital because you had chest pain.
- Lab tests of your blood found that your cardiac enzymes were 
normal (not elevated), and you had electrocardiograms (EKGs) 
that did not show a heart attack.
- You had an imaging test called a CT angiogram of your chest. 
There was no sign of a blood clot in your lung (pulmonary 
embolus) and no signs of aortic dissection. However, the CT 
angiogram showed a mass in the mediastinum that is likely a 
thymoma that should be followed up as an outpatient.
- The CTA showed thickening of your esophagus that could be a 
sign of esophagitis (inflammation of the esophagus), which was 
likely causing your chest pain.
- You were treated with a GI cocktail medication and a proton 
pump inhibitor that helps to reduce acid in the stomach, and 
your pain improved.
- You were noted to have slow heart rates and a pause on cardiac 
telemetry monitoring. You should see your cardiologist Dr. 
___ in clinic for follow up.

WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN I GO HOME?  
================================  
- Continue to take the GI cocktail and proton pump inhibitor.
- Follow up with your gastroenterology doctor. We recommend 
getting an endoscopy to look at your esophagus.
- You should get a test called an ankle-brachial index (ABI) as 
an outpatient to work up your left calf tightness.

Thank you for allowing us to be involved in your care, we wish 
you all the best!

BRIEF SUMMARY
===============
___ with T1DM c/b ESRD s/p renal/pancreas transplant in ___ c/b 
pancreas rejection, admitted from prison for right toe gangrene 
and osteomyelitis. He was evaluated by Vascular Surgery and 
Podiatry. He underwent angioplasty and limited amputation but 
continued to have poor wound healing and eventually required 
trans-metatarsal amputation of all five toes. He was initially 
treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics which were discontinued 
after definitive source control. He was discharged to pain free 
on dual antiplatelet therapy, high-dose statin, and optimized 
insulin regimen with close Podiatry and Vascular follow-up.

admitted for ___ on CKD likely in the setting of poor po intake

# Acute on chronic kidney injury. The patient presents with 
worsening Cr (4.9) in the setting of DM nephropathy. Baseline Cr 
is 3.0. Patient had been advised to hold his home Losartan and 
Lasix 48 hours prior to presentation, which continued to be held 
during his hospital stay. He currently has a fistula in the 
right upper extremity that is functional, but has not yet 
started dialysis. FeUrea and improvement in Cr with IVF are 
consistent with pre-renal azotemia. Patient denied any focal 
infectious symptoms and remained hemodynamically stable. Most 
likely etiology is significantly decreased po intake in the 
setting of worsening uremia. Nutrition evaluated the patient and 
his meals were complemented with Nepro supplements. Creatinine 
on discharge is 3.4. He will continue Calcium carbonate, 
Nephrocaps, Ascorbic acid, Vitamin D. Losartan and Lasix will be 
held until labs are drawn at his PCP's office and decision to 
restart will be based off those results.

# Fever. Spiked a fever to 101.1 on ___ which resolved 
without Tylenol. Given that he did not endorse any infectious, 
focal symptoms, additional workup was deferred. He was monitored 
for 36 hours thereafter and remained afebrile. 

# Hypertension. Elevated SBPs to 150s-170s/70s-80s, likely in 
the setting of holding home Losartan and Lasix due to patient's 
___. Per nephrology, these medications will continue to be held 
until patient has repeat labs drawn at his PCP's office to 
ensure resolution of ___. 

# Dysphagia. Patient reported dysphagia and odynophagia on the 
day prior to discharge. He was evaluated by Speech and Swallow 
who did not think he was at risk for aspiration. Continue to 
monitor at future visits.

# CAD s/p CABG ___. No evidence of cardiac decompensation of 
heart failure. Continue Aspirin, Metoprolol, and Atorvastatin

# Diabetic retinopathy. Continue Valproic acid, reportedly 
prescribed by his Retina specialist. Patient denies seizure 
history. 

# GERD: Continue Omeprazole. 

# Diabetes mellitus: Followed by ___. On home Lantus 22 units 
QHS. Decreased to 10 units QHS in the setting of his ___. 

# Allergies: Continue Loratidine prn 

# OSA: Continue CPAP at night 

# Gout: Stable. Continue Allopurinol ___ mg PO DAILY

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
--------------------
ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY ON CKD:
[ ]Advise repeat BMP-10 at PCP's visit before restarting 
Losartan and Furosemide
[ ]Encourage nutritional supplementation and increased po intake

cancer, as well as recent acute onset pain in her knee which has 
been worked up by orthopedics to some extent. This workup has 
revealed a likely bony lesion in her femur, and also new nodules 
in her lungs which are concerning for malignancy. The patient 
presented to our emergency department this morning with sudden 
onset chest pain since 3 AM today. She describes the pain as a 
mild, dull pain in her chest which does not radiate to her arm 
or up her jaw; it is somewhat worse when she takes a deep 
breath. She had some shortness of breath associated with the 
pain and also felt like her heart was racing. She also noted 
some sweating with the pain. She has never had pain like this 
before.

In the ED, her VS were 97.9 114 159/79 22 100% RA. Labs were 
notable for WBC 17.5 (82% PMNs), HCT 35.7, PLT 492. She also had 
a slightly increased AG of 16 with bicarb of 22. A first set of 
troponins was negative. Lactate was 3.0 and the pt was 
hyperglycemic to 238. UA positive for protein, ketones, and 
glucose. A CXR showed no acute intrapulmonary process. Wet read 
of ___ ultrasound showed no DVT. CTA showed no PE but did show 
nodules and lymph nodes suspicious for malignancy. The patient 
was admitted to medicine for pain control and further 
evaluation.

Upon transfer to the floor, VS were 99.2 160/88 105 22 100% RA. 
The pt was uncomfortable and in a lot of pain but interactive 
and appropriate. She reports that her chest pain has largely 
resolved, though she continues to have some dyspnea and 
sweating. Her leg pain is excruciating, ___ in severity, and 
she is unable to walk or move the leg at all. Her leg pain has 
been gradually increasing over the past ___ wks, and she notes a 
fist-size hard lump on her R distal thigh. The pain is worst 
over the R medial aspect of her knee. She has been taking 
ibuprofen and oxycodone 15mg Q4H with minimal relief. Her last 
BM was 10d ago.

MICROBIOLOGY: 
Urine culture: E. coli pan-sensitive
.
CXR: IMPRESSION: No acute pulmonary process.
.
CTA: IMPRESSION:
1) No evidence of pulmonary embolism, aortic aneurysm or 
dissection.
2) Lung nodules suspicious for malignancy. Significant bilateral 
hilar
lymphadenopathy also suspect. If not already followed, recommend 
referring
patient for appropriate consultation.
.
R ___: IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.
.
R KNEE and FEMUR XRAY: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of 
___, there is little overallchange. Though there is some patchy 
osteopenia especially distally, this again is nonspecific, 
though it could be related to osseous metastasis. This region is 
distinct from the focal area of signal abnormalities seen in the 
distal femur anteriorly on the outside MRI (not definitely 
appreciated on this study).
.
R THIGH MRI: 
1. Diffuse infiltrative heterogeneous-appearing mass 
incompletely seen 
involving the diaphysis of the mid to distal femur with a large 
extraosseous soft tissue component deep to the vastus 
musculature with likely involvement of the vastus intermedius 
muscle and edematous changes in the remaining vastus 
musculature. Findings in the femur are detailed above highly 
concerning for metastatic disease given history of endometrial 
cancer versus less likely, but still possible, a primary 
malignant osseous neoplasm or lymphoma given permeative 
appearance on radiographs from ___. There is concern for 
intraarticular extension into the knee joint space 
anteromedially with 
disruption of cortex signal with also possible neoplastic 
involvement in the posterolateral knee joint space, detailed 
above. These findings have 
progressed in comparison to recent prior outside knee MRI from 
___. 
2. Moderate knee joint effusion. 
3. Fatty atrophy of the posterior and posteromedial compartment 
thigh 
musculature. 
4. Multifocal osseous involvement of the medial and lateral 
femoral condyles, likely also representing osseous metastatic 
disease. 
.
CT-GUIDED R THIGH BIOPSY:
IMPRESSION: Successful CT-guided biopsy of right femur mass and 
corresponding large anterior soft tissue component, as described 
above. The core biopsy specimens were sent to pathology and the 
cytology and RPMI specimen were also carried to cytology and 
pathology laboratory as separate specimens 
.
CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS: ___
1. Multiple ill-defined hypoenhancing areas in both kidneys are, 
given the history of malignancy, concerning for renal 
metastases. 
2. Subcentimeter pulmonary nodules in both lower lobes as 
described. 
3. Left adnexal structure as described. This may be better 
characterized 
with ultrasound to confirm or exclude ovarian tissue. 
4. Right adrenal nodule. 
.
TIB/FIB (AP AND LAT) RIGHT:
No oblique view or localizing history is available. Allowing for 
this, no 
lytic or sclerotic lesion is detected in the right lower leg. AP 
view shows some bony prominence along the lateral aspect of the 
proximal tibial metadiaphysis, difficult to evaluate on this 
view. There is no corresponding finding on knee radiographs 
dated ___ and therefore this is likely artifactual. If this 
orresponds t the area of clinical interest, then further 
assessment with AP, oblique, and lateral radiographs of the knee 
would be recommended. At the edge of these films, a known area 
of lucency in the distal femur is suggested. 
.
PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY:
Fullness in the right paratracheal area is unchanged over 
previous 
examinations and was shown to be due to benign fat deposition on 
chest CTA ___, however the left hilar mass is still 
present. Lungs are clear and there is no pleural effusion. Heart 
size normal. 
.
VENOUS DUP EXT BILATERAL:
RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: Multiple prominent right 
inguinal lymph 
nodes are present, the largest measuring 9 mm with diffusely 
abnormal 
echogenicity. There is normal compressibility, flow, and 
augmentation in the bilateral common femoral and right 
superficial and deep femoral, greater saphenous, and popliteal 
veins. Calf veins were not well visualized. Diffuse subcutaneous 
edema is present. 
IMPRESSION: 
1. No right lower extremity DVT above the knee. 
2. Diffuse subcutaneous edema.
.
RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: 
Grayscale and Doppler sonogram of the right common femoral, 
right superficial femoral and right popliteal veins showed 
normal compressibility, flow and augmentation. Calf veins are 
not well visualized on this study. Extensive subcutaneous edema 
is noted diffusely; however, there is more focal illdefined 
area of fluid ranging over approximately 3 cm extending along 
the anterior aspect of the femur within the right mid-lower 
thigh region. Multiple inguinal lymph nodes are noted within the 
right groin, the largest measures 3.1 x 0.7 cm. 
IMPRESSION: 
1. No evidence of DVT in right common femoral, superficial 
femoral and 
popliteal veins. Calf veins could not be visualized on today's 
study. 
2. Diffuse subcutaneous edema, however, there is more focal 
ill-defined area of fluid ranging over approximately 3 cm 
extending along the anterior aspect of the femur within the 
right mid-lower thigh region.",,"Metformin 1000mg PO BID

It was a pleasure taking care of your during your 
hospitalization at ___.

During this admission, you were found to have a mass in your 
right femur bone that was concerning for cancer. You underwent 
imaging tests and had biopsies done that returned highly 
suggestive of cancer. The Orthopaedics team took you to the 
operating room for a procedure to help with pain reduction in 
the right knee. Radiation oncology also saw you through the 
admission and gave you 5 treatments of radiation therapy to the 
right knee to help with pain control.

Pain control was an on-going issue for you during this 
admission. We have adjusted your pain medication regimen so that 
you are now taking 10mg of methadone three times daily with oral 
dilaudid for breakthrough pain. Lidocaine patches as well as 
scheduled acetaminophen and ibuprofen were started during this 
admission to help with pain control.

During this admission, you also received one (1) dose of 
chemotherapy known as carboplatin. You tolerated the 
chemotherapy well with no side effects of nausea or vomitting. 

Your blood pressure medication regimen was modified during this 
admission. Your oral diabetes medications were discontnued 
during this admission, and you have been transtitioned to 
insulin for control of your blood sugars.

Please take all medications as prescribed.

diarrhea, constipation, and fevers.

Summary of past two hospitalizations:
1) ___ Episode #1: Patient suffered mechanical fall on ___
(tripped over rug) and fractured her left femur. Admitted to
___ and underwent ORIF of fracture complicated by
perioperative hypotension to SBPs=80s requiring IV pressors
according to the records, and suffered Acute Tubular Necrosis
(ATN) on her diabetic+HTNsive CKD. Almost required hemodialysis
but kidneys healed.

2) ___ Episode #2: Patient had another mechanical fall on
___ and suffered right femoral fracture. In ED at
___, patient actually became hypotensive leading to an
asystolic cardiac arrest requiring CPR, intubation, and 
pressors,
but she was successfully resuscitated. She was felt to be septic
leading to her cardiac arrest, and was treated with IV
antibiotics and pressors. Eventually underwent ORIF of hip
fracture on ___. Patient suffered ___ on CKD but according
to the documentation, did not require hemodialysis and her
creatinine improved with time and IV diuresis for volume
overload.

Patient's Cr actually was back to her baseline=1.90 on labs from
___ drawn by her visiting nurse. However, patient's renal
function has progressively worsened over the past 2 months, with
values of 2.2 on ___ and 3.40 on ___. Increasing dosage of 
Lasix
to current dose of 40mg BID and addition of Spironolactone has
paralleled this increase in creatinine.

Currently, she is comfortable in bed, stating that she would 
like to get alot of the fluid out of her legs.

extensive PMH including including CAD, atrial fibrillation, CKD 
Stage 4, nephrotic range proteinuria, DM2, and hypertension who 
presents with significant edema and ___ on CKD. She was a direct 
admit by her nephrologist, Dr. ___ worsening creatinine 
and b/l lower leg edema. He believed that the recent increase 
creatinine paralleled the recent escalation of diuretic therapy 
in order to control worsening lower leg edema. The goal was to 
complete a work-up on her suspected acute on chronic renal 
failure, evaluation for CHF, and monitored IV diuresis.

___ on CKD: The pt has significant lower extremity edema 
that has been worsening over the past couple of months. She was 
started on Lasix IV at admission and her weight. I/Os were 
monitored via Foley. Nephrology was consulted and they 
recommended adding Metolazone on admission day #2. She responded 
very well and over about ___ days she was negative ___. On 
___, the edema was substantially improved and the skin was more 
taut in the lower extremities. It was decided that the diuretics 
should be transitioned to her normal home PO Lasix dose with the 
added Metolazone PO medication on a MWF schedule. During this 
time her BUN/Cr remained consistenet (70-80/~3). Electrolytes 
were also monitored and remained stable. Urine lytes and UA were 
sent. FeNa was 2.2%. It appears that the element ___ did not 
reverse and that it is most likely a progression of her CKD. 
___ of the lower extremity were negative, and a cardiac echo 
was done. The cardiac echo was fairly consistent with one done 
in ___. An echo from her hospitalization at ___ recently was 
requested.

3.Eat slowly.  Continue to take 30 minutes to eat a meal and 
chew your foods thoroughly. 

4.Surround yourself with healthy foods. Clean out your cabinets 
of any trigger or unsafe foods.

5.Keep a food journal or track your intake on-line.  Record 
what you eat, portion sizes, and the time you eat.  You may want 
to include your mood and hunger level, as well.

6.Avoid skipping meals.  Always eat at regular times to avoid 
overeating later in the day.

stop when you are full.

8.Be active.  Engage in at least ___ minutes of physical 
activity most (if not all) days of the week. 

9.Regularly check your weight.  Give yourself an acceptable 
range (i.e. 5 pounds).  This prevents slip ups from becoming 
bigger problems down the road.

10. Make small changes.  Set small, reasonable goals to keep on 
track. 

11. Reward yourself.  Treat yourself when you reach goals with 
a non-food treat (i.e. pedicure, movie). 

12. Ask for support. Call the ___ nutrition clinic for","with understanding verbalized and

It was a pleasure taking care of you here at ___ 
___. You were admitted to our hospital for 
gastric cancer. You had an attempted Robot-assisted laparoscopic 
partial gastrectomy and gastroscopy on ___ without 
complications. You tolerated the procedure well and are 
ambulating, stooling, tolerating a regular diet, and your pain 
is controlled by pain medications by mouth. You are now ready to 
be discharged to home. Please follow the recommendations below 
to ensure a speedy and uneventful recovery. 

ACTIVITY:
- Do not drive until you have stopped taking pain medicine and 
feel you could respond in an emergency.
- You may climb stairs. You should continue to walk several 
times a day. 
- You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until 
you see your surgeon at your next visit. 
- You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable. 
Slowly increase your activity back to your baseline as 
tolerated.
- Heavy exercise may be started after 6 weeks, but use common 
sense and go slowly at first. 
- No heavy lifting (10 pounds or more) until cleared by your 
surgeon, usually about 6 weeks. 
- You may resume sexual activity unless your doctor has told you 
otherwise.

HOW YOU MAY FEEL: 
- You may feel weak or ""washed out"" for 6 weeks. You might want 
to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you.
- You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your 
throat during the surgery.

YOUR BOWELS:
- Constipation is a common side effect of narcotic pain medicine 
such as oxycodone. If needed, you may take a stool softener 
(such as Colace, one capsule) or gentle laxative (such as milk 
of magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of these 
medicines without a prescription.
- If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain 
moving the bowels, call your surgeon.
- After some operations, diarrhea can occur. If you get 
diarrhea, don't take anti-diarrhea medicines. Drink plenty of 
fluids and see if it goes away. If it does not go away, or is 
severe and you feel ill, please call your surgeon.

PAIN MANAGEMENT:
- You are being discharged with a prescription for **oxycodone 
for pain control. You may take Tylenol as directed, not to 
exceed 3500mg in 24 hours. Take regularly for a few days after 
surgery but you may skip a dose or increase time between doses 
if you are not having pain until you no longer need it. You may 
take the oxycodone for moderate and severe pain not controlled 
by the Tylenol. You may take a stool softener while on narcotics 
to help prevent the constipation that they may cause. Slowly 
wean off these medications as tolerated. 
- Your pain should get better day by day. If you find the pain 
is getting worse instead of better, please contact your surgeon.

If you experience any of the following, please contact your 
surgeon: 
- sharp pain or any severe pain that lasts several hours
- chest pain, pressure, squeezing, or tightness
- cough, shortness of breath, wheezing
- pain that is getting worse over time or pain with fever
- shaking chills, fever of more than 101
- a drastic change in nature or quality of your pain
- nausea and vomiting, inability to tolerate fluids, food, or 
your medications
- if you are getting dehydrated (dry mouth, rapid heart beat, 
feeling dizzy or faint especially while standing)
-any change in your symptoms or any symptoms that concern you

Additional: 
*- pain that is getting worse over time, or going to your chest 
or back
*- urinary:  burning or blood in your urine or the inability to 
urinate

MEDICATIONS:
- Take all the medicines you were on before the operation just 
as you did before, unless you have been told differently.
- If you have any questions about what medicine to take or not 
to take, please call your surgeon. 

WOUND CARE: 
- dressing removal:
- You may remove your dressings tomorrow ___ and shower that 
same day with any bandage strips that may be covering your 
wound. Do not scrub and do not soak or swim, and pat the 
incision dry. If you have steri strips, they will fall off by 
themselves in ___ weeks. If any are still on in two weeks and 
the edges are curling up, you may carefully peel them off.
 Do not take baths, soak, or swim for 6 weeks after surgery 
unless told otherwise by your surgical team. 
-Notify your surgeon is you notice abnormal (foul smelling, 
bloody, pus, etc) or increased drainage from your incision site, 
opening of your incision, or increased pain or bruising. Watch 
for signs of infection such as redness, streaking of your skin, 
swelling, increased pain, or increased drainage. 

Please call with any questions or concerns. Thank you for 
allowing us to participate in your care. We hope you have a 
quick return to your usual life and activities.

Home with ___:
You had a Foley catheter in your bladder placed by urology on 
the day of your surgery after difficulty trying to place it.
You will keep the catheter until your appointment with Urology 
in 5 days (please call the number below to schedule your 
appointment), who will decide if you need it longer or attempt 
to remove it and see if you are able to void.
 Empty the bag as needed and as shown to you by nursing staff. 
You will be given a leg bag before your discharge, that you may 
use for short trips. This is a smaller bag that straps to your 
leg, to take home and wear if you are traveling outside your 
home. This holds a smaller amount than the bag you have now, so 
it needs to be emptied more often. Some people find it easier to 
use the larger bad when they are at home or carry it with them.

your airways. After the surgery, your breathing improved. 

You also have experienced episodes of chest pain, that was 
reproducible with pressing on your chest. Some of the chest pain 
can occur following your surgery. An electrocardiogram looking 
at your heart and lab tests sent were normal. We are reassured 
that there are no acute issues with your heart that need 
immediate interventions.

Finally, you were experiencing episodes of tachycardia, with 
fast heart beats. The EKGs we captured of your heart were 
normal, and the episodes of tachycardia seems to have decreased 
following management of your post-surgical pain. We recommend 
following up with your primary care physician about further work 
up.  

Please continue using the Acapella flutter valve twice a day to 
help loosen the secretions in your air ways, which will help 
prevent pneumonia.

STUDIES/IMAGING
===============
___ Cardiovascular ECHO: Very poor quality images. The 
right heart was completely nonvisualized. The left atrium is 
mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is at least 
15 mmHg. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to 
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality 
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic 
function is normal (LVEF = 65%). There is considerable 
beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular ejection 
fraction due to an irregular rhythm. The aortic root is mildly 
dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly 
dilated. The aortic valve is not well seen. There is no aortic 
valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. 
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial 
effusion.  

___ Cardiovascular ECG: Atrial flutter with variable A-V 
conduction delay. Right bundle-branch block. Left anterior 
fascicular block. Compared to the previous tracing of ___ 
the rhythm is more clearly atrial flutter with variable block 
today, although I suspect that the prior ECG also represents 
atrial flutter with 2:1 A-V conduction as it is more difficult 
to appreciate due to the more rapid rate. Clinical correlation 
is suggested. 

___BD & PELVIS W & W/O: No central or 
peripheral DVT identified although examination is moderately 
limited by body habitus and evaluation of the pelvis is also 
limited by streak artifact from residual contrast in the 
bladder. 

___ Imaging CTA CHEST: 
1. Limited exam.  No evidence of central pulmonary embolism.  
Evaluation of the segmental and subsegmental pulmonary arteries 
is limited by respiratory motion. 
2. 4 mm left upper lobe pulmonary nodule. 
3. Borderline enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes may be reactive.  
Correlate 
with clinical symptoms 

___ Imaging UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS: No evidence of deep 
venous thrombosis in the right lower extremity veins.

___ Imaging CHEST (PORTABLE AP): Suboptimal study due to 
underpenetration presumed secondary to patient body habitus.  
Enlarged cardiomediastinal silhouette.  Possible underlying 
mediastinal lipomatosis.  Possible central pulmonary vascular 
engorgement.   

___ Cardiovascular ECG: Probable sinus tachycardia. Right 
bundle-branch block. Possible prior inferior wall myocardial 
infarction. No previous tracing available for comparison.","This is a ___ year old male with past medical history of OSA, 
morbid obesity admitted ___ w new atrial flutter, status 
post initiation and uptitration of rate control agents, started 
on rivaroxaban for anticoagulation, seen by cardiology and 
recommended for outpatient cardioversion, able to be discharged 
home.  
  
# Atrial flutter: On admission, HR up to 130-140s. Refractory to 
multiple metop IV pushes and PO 25 metop in ED. Negative trops 
x2. TSH WNL. ___, CTA negative for DVT despite elevated 
d-dimer.  No changes with carotid massage or vasalva, still 
persistent despite increasing doses of dilt.  TTE results as 
aforementioned.  Patient eventually stabilized with dilt 240mg 
BID, metop succinate 200mg BID with HR in 80-90s and SBPs 
120-130s.  Patient was initially started on apixiban, then 
switched to rivaroxaban given limited data of apixiban in obese 
patients.  Given high risk for anesthesia and TEE plus DCCV, it 
was decided patient would undergo potential DCCV at a later 
date.  In addition to the aforementioned recommendations, Atrius 
cardiology also recommended starting Lasix 20mg QD and aldactone 
25mg QD which patient tolerated well.

# Acute diastolic CHF - Patient admitted with reports of 
worsening ___ edema. Patient underwent TTE and was seen by 
___ cardiology for above---they felt that this was most likely 
acute diastolic CHF and recommended initiation of Lasix and 
aldactone.  Would consider rechecking electrolytes within 2 
weeks of discharge.

# OSA: Continued on CPAP at night. Counseled on importance of 
weight loss.  Met with nutritionist for further discussions of 
healthy lifestyle changes to help risk reduction in heart 
disease and modification of other risk factors.

=====================================
ICU COURSE:
=====================================
# Shock - septic
# Pyelonephritis:
#ecoli bacteremia 
 patient presented with hypotension to ___ requiring 5L IVF 
and pressor support in ED. CT abdomen/pelvis revealed right 
kidney with surrounding stranding concerning for  right 
pyelonephritis as well as mild stranding around the left kidney 
also raises possibility of bilateral pyelonephritis. Of note, 
patient's previous urine cultures in ___ grew E. coli (pan 
sensitive), Raoultella planticola, Citrobacter, and Enterococcus 
(pan sensitive). ___ blood culture results with ecoli in 
___ bottles.  On norepinephrine while in ___ ED, stopped on 
arrival to ___. 
Pt will be treated with 3 weeks of antibiotics-IV ceftriaxone ___. Last day ___. Weekly CBC, lfts, chemistries while on IV 
ceftriaxone.

# Concern for emphysematous cystitis vs. bladder perforation: 
Noted to have possibly extraluminal air on CT scan on admission. 
Urology consulted for question of bladder perforation. Per 
urology team, she has no obvious mechanism for bladder 
perforation (recent foley or procedures). Based on location of 
air noted on CT scan, any perforation, if present, would be 
retroperitoneal, and so the management would consist of 
decompression with urinary bladder catheter. Emphysematous 
cystitis is a potential cause of bladder perforation; management 
consists of antibiotics and bladder decompression. Urology 
recommended against cystogram, as this may distend the bladder 
and risk worsening septic spread. 
 Will treat with bladder decompression and IV antibiotics.
Final urology recs:
 Final recs: 
- improve blood sugar control as much as possible
- total of 3 weeks of antibiotics. ___, last day ___
- foley for 1 more week, then voiding trial
- follow up in ___ clinic in ___ weeks

in diameter. 
Opacification of the gallbladder was incomplete. 
There was evidence of a hilar stricture involving both the CHD,
as well as left and right main intrahepatic ducts. 
The total length of the stricture was 3 cm. 
This is compatible with a Type IV hilar stricture. 
A biliary sphincterotomy was made with a sphincterotome. 
There was no post-sphincterotomy bleeding. 
Both the right and left IHD were cannulated with wires using
standard double-wire technique. 
A 6 mm hurricane dilation balloon was used to dilaton the right
and left main ducts as well as CHD. Cytology brushings of the
hilum were performed. 
A ___ x 15 cm biliary plastic straight stent was placed into 
the
right IHD. 
An 8.5 F x 14 cm biliary plastic straight stent was attempted 
to
be placed into the left IHD but was unable to traverse the

had spread to your lymph nodes and to your liver. During you 
stay you had an MRI of your biliary system and also a procedure 
called an ERCP in which we took biopsies of your lesion and also

insulin.

# Hyperglycemia: Secondary to not taking long acting insulin for 
4 weeks. Patient reported blood sugars ranging from 200 to over 
400 in week prior to admission, but did not present with 
metabolic acdiosis (vbg pH 7.32; but bicarb 24). Patient lost 11 
lbs in past month and had several falls in the setting of likely 
orthostatic hypotension secondary to hypovolemia. Significantly 
volume down on presentation, received 3L NS in Ed. Patient's 
Potassium on admission 5.2, so patient's volume repleted 
overnight with NS +KCl. Patient's blood sugars improved s/p home 
dose Levemir in ED, and small dose of Glargine (15units) on 
night of admission. On morning of discharge, patient's 
electrolytes within normal limits and his blood sugars well 
controlled. Patient discharged with instructions to resume home 
insulin regimen and follow up with ___ provider and PCP.

#Hyponatremia: Sodium 127 in setting of hyperglycemia to 400's. 
Corrected sodium on admission 133. Patient volume repleted with 
NS+KCl and sodium normalized.

___: Patient's creatinine 2.2 on admission, baseline 0.7-0.9 
per ___ physician. Likely pre-renal in setting of hypovolemia 
secondary to osmotic diuresis. BUN/Cr 26, further supporting 
pre-renal cause. Improved to ___ s/p 5L IVF. Patient instructed 
to continue hydration at home and follow up labs will be drawn 
at ___ appointment ___. Held patient's Lisinopril at 
discharge, but may be resumed at PCP's discretion pending 
resolution of ___.

Chronic Issues
#CAD: patient reported history of CAD s/p MI, CVA. Denied stents 
or CABG.  Patient experienced no chest pain, pressure or sob 
during admission. Patient continued on clopidogrel, 
Atorvastatin. Propanolol initially held in settin of 
hypotension, but resumed upon discharge.

#HTN: patient's blood pressure low on admission, compared to 
baseline. Held home HCTZ, lisinopril. Neither were resumed upon 
discharge, as HCTZ may exacerbate hyperglycemia or electrolyte 
abnormalities and Lisinopril may worsen ___. Both may be resumed 
at PCP's discretion. 

Transitional Issues:
-Patient presented with creatinine 2.2 (baseline 0.7-0.9), in 
setting of hypovolemia, improved to 1.4 with fluids. Should 
repeat labs within one week of discharge to Creatinine returns 
to baseline.
-Patient presented with hyperglycemia in setting of not taking 
Levemir for one month. Patient should be monitored closely for 
hyperglycemia and med compliance by ___ and would likely

who presents with 6 weeks of increasing jaw pain, found to have 
a R temporal mass on outside hospital imaging and 
lung/adrenal/back masses on imaging here. The patient noted jaw 
pain starting in his R temporal region 6 weeks ago.  He was seen 
by his dentist for this pain who then referred him to an oral 
surgeon for further evaluation. He was seen by an oral surgeon 4 
weeks ago, where he had xrays of his teeth performed. The oral 
surgeon thought the pt may have decay of one of his wisdom 
teeth, so he removed the pts wisdom tooth 2 weeks ago. The 
patient continued to have R jaw pain after the extraction, so 
the oral surgeon arranged for the pt to have a head CT 1 week 
ago. This head CT showed swelling of the right temporalis muscle 
and underlying destruction of the temporal bone. Differential 
diagnosis included lymphoma, metastatic disease, and 
rhabdomyosarcoma. His PCP arranged for him to have an MRI of his 
facial bones this week, but over the past week the patient has 
had increasing R jaw pain. He notes a sharp constant R TMJ pain 
that radiates up to his temple, to the back of his head, and 
down his R jawline.  He has been taking vicodin every ___ hours 
with only minimal relief of symptoms. The pt has been having 
increasing difficulty with opening his mouth due to pain, and 
has had difficulty eating/drinking. He has lost 13 lbs over the 
past ___ weeks, and does endorse mildly decreased appetite. He 
has been mainly only able to tolerate liquids, applesauce, 
pudding, etc.

about 6 months ago. He presented to his PCP and was told this 
was likely a sebaceous cyst. He notes that this mass has been 
enlarging, but is not tender.
.
The patient denies any nightsweats, lymph node enlargement, 
fevers, chills, rectal bleeding, shortness of breath, chest 
pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, nausea, vomiting, 
or loss of energy. He does admit to ___ months of a 
nonproductive cough. However, over the past 2 weeks since the 
extraction of his wisdom tooth he has been coughing up phlegm 
mixed with a small amount of blood when he awakens in the

In the ED, the pts vitals were: T 98.7 BP 168/87 P 90 R 18 Sat 
97%RA. He was given Vicodin ___ mg tablets x2, morphine 4 mg 
IV x2, dilaudid 2 mg IV x1 with no relief of his pain. He also 
received zofran 4 mg IV x1. He was noted to have a lesion on his 
back, and ultrasound revealed this to be a 5 x 5 x3 cm vascular 
mass. He then had a CT of his chest, abdomen, and pelvis which 
showed a 5 cm mass in the left lower lobe with multiple necrotic 
left hilar and left axillary nodes. He was noted to have a 4.3 
cm right adrenal mass, a 2 cm x 1.7 cm enlarged lymph node in 
the right axilla, and a 5 x 7 cm subcutanous mass of the mid 
back. He was admitted for further malignancy work up and 
treatment of his pain.

Imaging:
OSH CT facial bones ___: There is swelling and prominence of 
the right temporalis muscle. There is underlying permeative 
destruction of the temporal squamosa. The process involves the 
temporalis muscle eccentrically along the external aspect of the 
temporal bone. Differential considerations inculde lymphoma or 
rhabdomyosarcoma. Metastatic disease cannot be excluded. The 
maxilla and mandible are unremarkable. 
.
___ Ultrasound of lesion on back:
FINDINGS: Solid mass is located on the midline in the upper 
thoracic region measuring approximately 2.9 x 5.3 x 5.4 cm. The 
mass is extremely vascular. The differential diagnosis includes 
metastic disease and soft tissue sarcomas. 
.
___ Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis CT scan:
IMPRESSION:  
1. Left lower lobe lung mass is associated with multiple left 
hilar necrotic nodes and left axillary node. Left pleural mass, 
right adrenal mass and a subcutaneous mass within the upper 
thoracic region are noted. Findings are compatible with 
metastatic disease most likely from primary lung cancer. 
Metastatic melanoma is another likely possiblity. 
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions. 
3. Cholelithiasis with no evidence of cholecystitis. 
.
___ MRI head:
IMPRESSION: 
Dominant enhancing lesion involving squamous and mastoid areas 
of the right temporal bone, right temporalis muscle, with 
associated dural component and enhancement, with mass effect on 
the subjacent right temporal gyri. Enhancing left frontal 
parenchymal lesion, most likely metastasis. Additional small 
enhancing focus in the posterior right occipital lobe, too small 
to definitely characterize as intra- or extra-axial, but given 
presence of disruption of the inner table of the occipital bone, 
probably represents osseous metastasis with dural involvement. 

Labs on discharge:
***********","This is a ___ yo M with a history of HTN, CAD, and hyperlipidemia 
who presents with 6 weeks of increasing jaw pain, found to have 
a R temporal mass on outside hospital imaging and

that are not due to infection. Your blood tests, urine tests, 
chest Xray, and abdominal ultrasound showed no evidence of

Conclusions  
PRE-CPB:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. No atrial septal defect is 
seen by 2D or color Doppler. 

Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left 
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular 
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 

No thoracic aortic dissection is seen. The aortic valve leaflets 
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. 

The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened and redundant. 
Atrialization of the posterior leaflet insertion is seen. There 
is prolapse of all three scallops of the posterior mitral 
leaflets with the p2 scallop being most significantly affected. 
The mitral valve leaflets do not fully coapt. There is both a 
central and eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of MR. ___ 
to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the 
eccentric nature of the regurgitant jet, its severity may be 
significantly underestimated (Coanda effect). 

Dr ___ was notifed of findings in person at time of study. 

POST-CPB:
The anterior mitral leaflet now spans the entire mitral annulus 
and the posterior leaflet can be minimally seen, consistent with 
mitral valve repair. A mitral annular ring is seen. There is no 
residual MR.

___ systolic function remain preserved. Other valvular 
function remains unchanged.

There is no evidence of dissection.

___ in ___ in the left breast.  This was an invasive
ductal carcinoma, 3.5 cm, node negative, estrogen receptor
negative. She was treated with breast conserving surgery and
postoperative radiation therapy.

  She did well until ___.  At that time, she presented with
another carcinoma of the left breast.  This was an
infiltrating ductal carcinoma grade III with lymphatic vessel
invasion, measuring at least 1.2 cm in size.  She went on to
undergo a left completion mastectomy for local control. 
Reconstruction was delayed at that time due to a history of
smoking and obesity.

She then went on to undergo a breast reconstruction in ___,
which was  complicated.  Following the mastectomy, she received
six cycles of CMF.

In ___ the age of ___, she developed a carcinoma of
the right breast.  She was found to have an invasive ductal
carcinoma 2.5 cm, grade III, EIC negative, LVI positive with one
of ten nodes positive for metastatic disease. 
The cancer was ER negative, HER-2/neu negative.  She was treated
with Cytoxan, Adriamycin to full dose, followed by 12 weeks of
Taxol and radiation therapy.

Subsequently, she developed right arm lymphedema that waxes and
wanes and has been able to be managed with the compression 
sleeve
and gauntlet and diuretics.

The patient presents requiring mastectomy having had breast 
cancer twice in the past and now been found to be gene positive. 
 She is opting for another
latissimus flap.  She had a left latissimus flap many years ago, 
approximately ___ years ago, but had significant problems with 
this flap requiring skin grafting to the chest wall.  I felt 
that expanding the area would allow us to remove the superior 
pole skin graft and give her better aesthetic result and then 
place a small implant to give improved volume on the right side.

Conclusions: The left atrium is markedly dilated. No atrial 
septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color 
Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers. Left ventricular wall 
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal 
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall 
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve 
is not well seen. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no 
pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space which most 
likely represents a prominent fat pad.

We are changing your medications as follows:  
- adjusting your insulin regimen
- starting atorvastatin and stopping simvastatin
- start fenofibrate
- please take aspirin 81mg every day
 
Please take your other medications as prescribed.  

Please followup with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.  

If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur,

bleeding from your lower gastrointestinal track. You needed to 
be admitted to the ICU because of the extent of your bleeding 
and the need for significant blood transfusions and blood 
pressure support. Multiple attempts were made to determine the 
source of the bleeding including a colonoscopy and a special 
imaging scan. Unfortunately, we could not identify the source of 
your bleeding. However, you were given multiple units of blood 
and were stablized in the ICU. Your condition improved and you 
were able to be moved out of the ICU to the regular medicine 
floor. Your bleeding slowed and finally stopped. However, while 
on the medicine floor, you had several episodes of a fast 
irregular heart beat called atrial fibrillation which resulted 
in low blood pressure. Medications were given to control your 
heart rate so that it would go at normal rate and your blood 
pressure improved. In addition, you had lower leg pain. A 
special ultrasound was performed which showed that your had 
clots in both of your legs. Ususually this would be treated with 
anticoagulation medication; however, you could not receive these 
medications while you were in the hospital because of your 
bleeding. To prevent the clots from moving into your heart and 
lung, a special filter was placed in the vein leading to your 
heart. You were also found to have a urinary tract infection and 
were treated with antibiotics. Your condition improved and you 
were able to be discharge to a ___ facility to 
complete your recovery.

.
# DVT: On the floor, pt complained of leg pain. On exam was 
tender to palpation and legs showed +1 edema. LENIS was performe 
and demonstraed b/l dvts. Because of continued bleed, the pt 
could not receive anticoagulation so a IVC filter was placed 
w/out complications.  
.  
# CAD: Pt's history of CAD was unclear.  She had known LBBB, Q 
waves on EKG. Pt does not believe any past AMI. Denies any chest 
pain or new onset SOB.  Metoprolol and aspirin were initially 
held in setting of GIB.  Metoprolol was eventually restarted 
along with diltazem (see below) given afib. Isosorbide 
mononitrate continued to be held given concern over bleeding and 
risk of hypotension.
.  
# CHF: TTE performed at admission showed preserved EF > 55% and 
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal 
biventricular systolic function, moderate tricuspid 
regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension.  Home triamterene and HCTZ were held during ICU 
stay due to LGIB. These need for restarting these medication 
will need to be re-evaluated as an outpt as the pt recovers. 
Currently blood pressure is stable on metoprolol 25mg TID and 
diltizem 30mg QID.  
.  
# Rapid afib: In the ICU, HR increased to 120s on HD2; she was 
given one time dose of diltiazem 5mg which decreased HR to ___ 
but pt remained in afib. She was given low dose beta blocker and 
converted back to sinus rhythm. On the floor, pt had 2 episodes 
of afib w/RVR which required pushing of IV diltiazem and support 
with IV fluids given low blood pressure. Rates were in the 160s 
and pt was becoming hypotensive; on heart rate measure showed 
rate of 207 but repeat was in the lower 100s. Pt broke and 
returned to sinus with IV diltazem. Pt was eventually placed on 
a regimen of 25mg metoprolol TID and 30mg Diltiazem QID; this 
may need to be adjusted and she recovers.
.
# ?Sleep apnea: Oxygen saturation in high ___ on room air but 
fell to ___ while asleep. She preferred to sleep w/O2 at night 
which improved sats.  She should be assessed with sleep study as 
outpatient. 
.  
# Interstitial lung disease: Pt had unclear history of 
interstitial lung disease and had been on low dose prednisone at 
home.  This was held during ICU course and continued to be held 
on the floor due to bleeding concerns. Pt also had some wheezing 
and coarse lung sound whihc improved w/nebulizer treatments. 
Howver, albuteol could not be used b/c of afib so ipratropium 
was used. Will need to reassess as outpt the need for 
prednisone. 
.
# Urinary retention: Patient is being treated for urinary 
urgency with incontinence. She had an episode of urinary 
retention for ~8hrs in which she was found to have 750 mL of 
urine in her bladder. This resolved without intervention with a 
post-void  volume of ~300 mL.
.
Pt has GI follow-up planned.
Pt is going to rehab facility to complete recovery and then will 
return to her assisted living facility.

ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic 
function are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall 
motion is normal. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear 
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic 
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. There is billowing of the anterior mitral 
leaflet. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Trace tricuspid 
regurgitation is seen. There is a very small pericardial 
effusion. 

 POST-BYPASS:
